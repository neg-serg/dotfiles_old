Clarifications:

The GNU General Public License or GPL is written for software projects.
However, we expressly want the GPL to be valid for artwork and relevant 
assets alone that are included in this project.

Source code, for this artwork project means:
    - where they exist, SVG;
    - otherwise, if applicable, the multi-layered formats XCF, PSD, SVGZ;
    - otherwise, if applicable, PNG or JPG/JPEG.

Regarding this project as a whole: the GPL applies exclusively to vector,
raster, bitmap, and/or multi-layered image files that may be considered artworks in this software project. 

The GPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry notices.
With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly useful. 
With this project a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory
containing the elements. You may follow this practise.

Inkscape may by default place a "Propriety License" property in SVG 
metadata, or otherwise display this in the GUI where no metadata license
tag exists; this declaration is to be ignored where it appears. 
All the artwork in this project is freely licensed under the GNU General
Public License and must be treated as such.
