1. Introduction                                        *wordpress-introduction*

WordPress.vim is a Vim plugin for WordPress Development.

Features:

* Auto-Completion for the WordPress API
* WP-CLI Integration
* Jump to Definition in WordPress Core
* UltiSnips Snippets
* Syntax Highlighting for WordPress PHP files.
* Markdown Syntax Highlighting for readme.txt

===============================================================================
2. Auto-Completion                                  *wordpress-auto-completion*

WordPress.vim extends phpcomplete.vim to provide Auto-Completions for
WordPress PHP files. If you have phpcomplete.vim installed no additional
configuration is required.

The default Vim completion key is 'C-x C-o' in insert mode. This will
open up a menu with the choices for the word at the cursor.

A couple of Vim plugins that make using completions much simpler are
*SuperTab* and *YouCompleteMe*.

SuperTab allows you to hit the 'Tab' key to view completions. And to
cycle through them with arrow keys.

A more advanced plugin is 'YouCompleteMe'. Unlike SuperTab which
requires you to hit a key to show the list of completions, YCM is an
as-you-type completion system, often only seen in IDEs.

It works well with the 'omnifunc' provided by phpcomplete. Hitting
any one of the PHP trigger keys, '->' or '::' will automatically show
completions for it.

===============================================================================
3. WordPress Hooks Integration                   *wordpress-hooks-integration*

WordPress.vim has close integration with WordPress hooks.

3.1 :Waction                                        *wordpress-hook-action*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ex command :Waction lists all the Action Hooks available. You can type
the initial few letters of the action and tab complete through to the
complete action name. Hitting <enter> will take you to the source of the
action in WordPress Core.

The :Waction command has 2 modes, 'invocation' and 'listeners'.

The 'invocation' mode corresponds to the source of the action, ie:-
'do_action'. And the 'listener' mode corresponds to the listeners of
that action ie:- 'add_action'.

For listener mode use without a <bang> - :Waction word
For invocation mode use with a <bang> - :Waction! word or :Waction word!

If the 'word' is omitted, the word under cursor or current selection is
used instead.

Some actions can have multiple matches. When this happens Vim's taglist is
filled with these matches. You can cycle through the matches with the
excommands, :tn and :tp. And to list all matches, use :tjump

3.2 :Wfilter                                        *wordpress-hook-filter*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ex command :Wfilter lists all the Filter hooks available. It works
similar to the the :Waction command and supports tab completion. Hitting
<enter> will take you to the source of the filter.

The :Wfilter command also has the same 2 modes, 'invocation' and
'listeners'.

The 'invocation' mode corresponds to the source of the filter, ie:-
'apply_filters'. And the 'listener' mode corresponds to the listeners of
that filters ie:- 'add_filter'.

For listener mode use without a <bang> - :Wfilter word
For invocation mode use with a <bang> - :Wfilter! word or :Wfilter word!

If the 'word' is omitted, the word under cursor or current selection is
used instead.

When filters have multiple matches the taglist is filled with these
matches. You can cycle through the matches with the
excommands, *:tn* and *:tp*. And to list all matches, use *:tjump*

3.3 :CtrlPaction                                 *wordpress-hook-ctrlp-action*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When tab completing through the list of WordPress actions the number of
choices are too many and Vim will start using it's pager. This mode of
completion is quite cumbersome, especially if you don't know the name of
the specific action you need.

WordPress.vim includes integration with CtrlP to navigate such large
lists.

Instead of using the ex command, :CtrlPaction[!] to launch a CtrlP fuzzy matcher
window. Typing a few characters that make up the match is sufficient
enough to complete a name. You can also navigate with arrow keys to move
around in this window.

Hitting <enter> accepts the current match, and takes you to the
definition of that action.

The CtrlP variant also supports *<bang>*.

For listener mode use, :CtrlPaction
For invocation mode use, :CtrlPaction!

This feature requires the CtrlP plugin to be installed.

3.4 :CtrlPfilter                                 *wordpress-hook-ctrlp-filter*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similar to :CtrlPaction, The corresponding CtrlP ex command for faster WordPress filter
navigation is, :CtrlPfilter.

For listener mode use, :CtrlPfilter
For invocation mode use, :CtrlPfilter!

===============================================================================
4. WP-CLI Integration                                        *wordpress-wp-cli*

WordPress.vim is closely integrated with WP-CLI. You can easily run
WP-CLI commands without leaving Vim. When the presence of WP-CLI is
detected in a project, WordPress.vim adds corresponding Ex commands to
Vim.

For the WP-CLI command like, 'wp cache' the corresponding ex command
will be ':Wcache'. ie:- :W{command}. For commands with hyphens like 'wp
search-replace' you need to drop the hyphen and just use,
':Wsearchreplace' instead.

The Ex commands provide auto-completion using WP-CLI's 'wp cli
completions' subcommand.

You can get help for any command by using a Bang after the name of the
command or at the end.

:Wcache! - will show the details of the 'wp cache' command.

Most WP-CLI commands will work as expected. However some behaviour is
enhanced for better integration with Vim. These are listed below.

4.1 :Weval                                             *wordpress-wp-cli-eval*
----------------

The :Weval adds support for Vim ranges. You can make a Visual Mode
selection and then use the command :'<,'>Weval and it will run 'wp eval'
on your selected lines.

Ranges can also be provide manually like, :5,10Weval.

4.2 :Wevalfile                                     *wordpress-wp-cli-evalfile*
----------------

The :Wevalfile command runs the 'wp evalfile' WP-CLI command. When the
file argument is not provided it runs 'evalfile' on the current file
itself.

4.3 :Wscaffold                                     *wordpress-wp-cli-scaffold*
----------------

WordPress.vim makes a few useful additions to 'wp scaffold'.

When you use ':Wscaffold' with the subcommands '_s', 'child-theme' or plugin,
it runs the corresponding 'wp scaffold' commands and immediately puts
you into the main generated file.

For themes this is the 'style.css' and for plugins it's the main plugin
PHP file.

When using ':Wscaffold taxonomy' or ':Wscaffold post-type' WordPress.vim
directly inserts the scaffolded snippet into the current file.

4.4 :Wpost                                            *wordpress-wp-cli-post*

WordPress.vim wraps the 'wp post' WP-CLI command with greater integration with
Vim. The default 'wp post create' starts a new editor instance and
creates a post once you have finished editing and close the
file.

Instead the ':Wpost create' command just creates a new Vim Buffer. Any
changes you write in this new buffer will create a new post. And subsequent
changes will result in updating the same post.

Similarly the ':Wpost edit {post_id}' command opens an existing post
into a new Vim Buffer. And changes written to this buffer will update
that post.

4.5 Long Running Commands                     *wordpress-wp-cli-long-running*

Some WP-CLI commands like 'wp core' are network dependent and take longer to
complete. Running them through Vim will block execution of the editor
until they complete. It is recommended that you run such commands via a
shell.

4.6 Shell Commands                                  *wordpress-wp-cli-shell*

The shell command `:Wshell` requires an interactive shell to work
correctly. This command is equivalent to running `:!wp shell`. It will
drop down to the shell while making sure to put you into the correct
project directory for WP-CLI.

===============================================================================
5. Jump to Core Definition                             *wordpress-jump-to-core*

As the name suggests this feature allows you to Jump to the Definition
of a function inside WordPress Core. To use this feature your project
needs to use WP-CLI or provide a manual path to WordPress with
g:wordpress_vim_wordpress_path.

This feature is implemented with CTags. You will only need to install
CTags. The plugin takes care of creating the tags file and configuring
Vim to use it.

To regenerate the 'tags' file use the ex-command, `:Wctags!`. Note: If
exuberant ctags is not found, the command will show an error message.
Verify that you have `ctags` installed.

If you are using the `g:wordpress_vim_ctags_path` variable, make sure
that it points to a valid exuberant ctags executable.

To jump to the definition of a function place your cursor on it, and hit
the key combo Ctrl-]. To move back to the where you were earlier use Ctrl-t
or Ctrl-o. You can also use the Ex command, :tjump name to jump to a tag.

Jump to Core has special support for WordPress hooks. When the cursor is
on the name of the action or filter hook in 'add_action' or
'add_filter', Ctrl-] will jump to the corresponding 'invocation' for that
action or filter.

Similarly when the cursor is on the name of the invocation either in
'do_action' or 'apply_filters', Ctrl-] will jump to the corresponding
'add_filter' or 'add_action' listeners instead.

The ex-command :Wdef can also be used to jump to a definition from ex mode.
It takes the name to look for. If not specified it defaults to using the
current visual selection and finally the current word under the cursor.

The default mappings for <c-]> and <c-w>] are modified to improve
sorting of the ctags results. To disable these custom mappings use,

    let g:wordpress_vim_jump_to_core_mappings = 0

To learn more about navigation with tags see, |tags-and-searches|.

===============================================================================
6. Snippets                                                *wordpress-snippets*

WordPress.vim comes with a few useful snippets to speed up common
WordPress development tasks. The snippets require the UltiSnips Vim
plugin.

A Snippet is like an interactive Web Form. Once you enter a Snippet you
are put at the first placeholder. As you start typing the placeholder
changes and also affects any dependent placeholders. You can cycle back and
forth between placeholders and Escape out when done.


6.1 Custom Taxonomy                               *wordpress-snippets-taxonomy*

===============================================================================
7. Syntax Highlighting                          *wordpress-syntax-highlighting*

7.1 PHP Syntax Highlighting                 *wordpress-php-syntax-highlighting*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

WordPress.vim extends the default PHP syntax highlighting with support
for the WordPress API. Importantly it highlights the use
of any deprecated function as Errors.

7.2 Readme.txt Syntax Highlighting          *wordpress-readme-syntax-highlighting*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The readme.txt file used by WordPress plugins & themes is treated as a
Markdown file and is highlighted as such. Further support is added for
highlighting fenced blocks as embedded PHP code.

7.3 Readme.txt Validation  *wordpress-readme-validation*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

WordPress.vim integrates with the Readme.txt validator on wordpress.org.
Anytime you save a readme.txt file, it will run your your file through
the Validator. Any errors or notes will be displayed in Vim's status
bar.

The defaults will auto validate the readme when the file was modified
and saved. You can turn off auto validation of the readme using,

    let g:wordpress_vim_readme_auto_validator = 0

You can also run this validator manually using the :Wreadme ex command.
It takes one argument equal to the path of the file to validate. It
defaults to the current project's readme.txt if not specified.

===============================================================================
8. Search in Codex                                  *wordpress-search-in-codex*

The :Wsearchcodex ex command adds support for searching on the Codex.
You can specify arguments to the command for the query to search.

The OpenBrowser.vim plugin is required to use this feature.

Eg:- :Wsearchcodex WP_User_Query

When arguments are omitted the current selection if present or the word
under cursor is used to query the Codex.

You can map this to a key sequence to allow quicker searching. For
instance, to map <leader>co to the :Wsearchcodex command use,

:nnoremap <leader>co :Wsearchcodex<CR>

===============================================================================
9. WpSeek.com API Integration                    *wordpress-wpseek-integration*

WordPress.vim integrates with the WpSeek.com to offer faster navigation
and searching.

9.1 Similar Functions                      *wordpress-wpseek-similar-functions*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The :Wsimilar ex command adds support for searching for similar
functions. It takes the keyword to search for as an argument. If absent
the current selection is used instead. If a visual mode selection is
absent the current word under the cursor is used as the keyword.

For Eg:- to search for functions similar to 'wp_redirect' use,

    :Wsimilar wp_redirect

This will show you prompt with the matches. Choosing an option will take
you directly to the definition of that function in WordPress Core.

9.2 Find Topics on WordPress.org *wordpress-wpseek-wordpress-org-topics*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The :Wtopics ex command adds support for searching for topics on
WordPress.org. It also takes the keyword to search for as an argument.
And if absent uses the current selection or current word under the
cursor instead.

For Eg:- to search for topics with matching the keyword, 'wp_redirect'
use,

    :Wtopics wp_redirect

You will be prompted to choose from an option. Choosing an option will
open the corresponding link in your browser.

===============================================================================
10. System Requirements                          *wordpress-system-requirements*

WordPress.vim requires Vim 7.3p97+.

WordPress.vim uses Progressive Enhancement to enable/disable features.
This means that the features that depend on other plugins/external tools are
only enabled if their presence is detected. A missing requirement will
not affect the behaviour of the rest of the plugin.

It is highly recommended to install the following plugins to get the
best experience.

* phpcomplete.vim - Enables Auto-Completion
* UltiSnips - Enables Code Snippets
* vim-markdown - Enables Markdown Syntax Highlighting of readme.txt
* SuperTab or YouCompleteMe - More intuitive Auto Completion &
  integration with UltiSnips
* php.vim - Better Syntax Highlighting
* OpenBrowser.vim - Enables Search in Codex
* CtrlP.vim - Enables Fuzzy matcher integration for WordPress hooks.

Additionally the following tools enhance WordPress.vim.

* WP-CLI - Enables :W ex commands & automatic WordPress path lookup.
* Exuberant CTags - Enables the Jump to Core Definition feature

===============================================================================
11. Customization                                       *wordpress-customization*

- g:wordpress_vim_autostart

Opening Vim inside a WordPress project directory will start
WordPress.vim automatically. When disabled you will need to open a file
inside a buffer first.

default: 1 (yes)
valid values: 1 or 0

- g:wordpress_vim_php_syntax_highlight

Controls whether custom PHP syntax highlighting is enabled. This option
if present toggles the custom syntax highlighting.

default: 1 (yes)
valid values: 1 or 0

- g:wordpress_vim_tags_file_name

The name of the Ctags file generated by Exuberant CTags.

default: tags
valid values: valid file name

- g:wordpress_vim_wordpress_path

The path to your WordPress installation. By default WordPress.vim
uses WP-CLI to find the path to your WordPress installation
automatically. However if you do not have WP-CLI installed you can still
use the |wordpress-jump-to-core| feature, by providing a valid
WordPress path manually.

default: not set
valid values: path to a WordPress install

- g:wordpress_vim_jump_to_core_mappings

Determines whether to add the custom mappings for <c-]> and <c-w>].

default: 1
valid values: 1 or 0

- g:wordpress_vim_readme_auto_validator
