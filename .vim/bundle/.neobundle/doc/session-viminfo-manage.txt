 1. INTRODUCTION                                              *workspaceIntro*

I did search job on vim.org, there are good plugins for vim session management.
But seems no one try to manage vim session and viminfo files both.
So I made it by myself.

This plug-in provides commands to save/load vim session and viminfo files both!
Even better, it can automatically load/save vim session and viminfo files 
when entering vim and leaving vim environment.

That are very useful if you want Vim to quickly swith between different 
projects, automatically loading the files you were last working on in that 
project, and enable you to continue where you left off. 

Terminology:
"Workspace files":
I will shortly call vim session and viminfo files as "Workspace files" in 
this manual.

==============================================================================
 2. FUNCTIONALITY                                     *workspaceFunctionality*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.1 SAVE WORKSPACE                               *workspaceSaveWorkspaceCore*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.2 LOAD WORKSPACE                               *workspaceLoadWorkspaceCore*

==============================================================================
 3. AUTOMATION                                            *workspaceAutomation*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAUNCHING VIM~ 
* When launching Vim, this plugin will detect current path and load default 
  workspace files(workspace.session and workspace.viminfo) if exist. 
* If no default workspace files found, it will check whether there are
  files having suffix ".session" and ".viminfo" in pair. 
  If yes, it will prompt a list for user selection if there are more than one 
  pair.

Example 1:
If you're at /home/test, there are: >
  workspace.session
  workspace.viminfo
  test.session
  test.viminfo
<
When you launch vim, it will load workspace.session and workspace.viminfo with 
prompt message by default.

Example 2:
If you're at /home/test, there are: >
  test01.session
  test01.viminfo
  test02.session
  test02.viminfo
<
When you launch vim, it will list all workspace files for your choice.
As following: >
  workspace: Please input the expected workspace index you want to load:
    [0] /home/test/test01
    [1] /home/test/test02
  Your input(q to exit this function of workspace plugin):
<
Then you type a legal number in range(0,1), it will load the specific
workspace files.
Also you can type 'Q' or 'q' to do nothing with workspace files.
If you give an exception, you will be required to input again. 

There is a little compatible problem in some tty console.
In some tty console, if you input something with a <CR>, it will echo all
message one time. Anyway, the function still works.   

LEAVING VIM~
Example 1: >
  : Savews my.ws       
  : Loadws wow.ws
  : Savews new.ws
  : qa
<
Result: This plugin will automatically save session and viminfo files to last 
        workspace files: 
          new.session
          new.viminfo
        
==============================================================================
 4. COMMANDS                                               *workspaceCommands*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:Savews                                                              *:Savews*

Save vim session and viminfo files when you type Ex command "Savews" with proper 
arguments.
Particularly, if option wsOverwrite is 1(This is default value), when you
exit from Vim, this plugin will save session and viminfo files to your last 
saved/loaded workspace files automatically.

Default Values:
  * Default name for workspace files is: 
      workspace.session 
      workspace.viminfo
  * Default saving path: 
      vim current path (Type Vim Ex command getcwd() to get it)

Example 1: >
  :Savews    
<
Result: Will create workspace.session and workspace.viminfo in current folder 
        if not existed. 
        Please see |'wsOverwrite'| for more details about overwrite behavior.

Example 2: >
  :Savews /home/myproject 
<
Result: Will create:
          /home/myproject/workspace.session
          /home/myproject/workspace.viminfo
        Please make sure folder /home/myproject existed beforehand.
        Please see |'wsOverwrite'| for more details about overwrite behavior.

Example 3: >
  :Savews my.ws
<
Result: Save to my.session and my.viminfo in current folder.
        Please see |'wsOverwrite'| for more details about overwrite behavior.

Example 4: >
  :Savews /home/myproject/my.ws
<
Result: You will get my.session and my.viminfo in /home/myproject folder 
        if /home/myproject existed.
        Please see |'wsOverwrite'| for more details about overwrite behavior.

Two point please keep in mind when using Savews:
* You must have suffix ".ws", if you want to specify name for session and  
  viminfo files, like example 3 and example 4. 
  Otherwise, they will have default name, workspace.session and 
  workspace.viminfo.
* Please remember to use :qwa to quit Vim if you want to reopen all windows/tabs
  you're editing.
  The reason is that Savews command will save workspace files automatically when
  you exit Vim.
  So if you have opened many windows/tabs, but closed them one by one, there 
  would be only one window is openning just before you exit Vim, workspace 
  plugin will only can remember the last window and just reopen it for you when 
  you enter Vim next time by loading your workspace files.

Other examples (I ignored :Savews in following Ex commands):
(Also below examples are my test cases)
/             # Would create /workspace.session, /workspace.viminfo
/.ws          # Failed: no name for .ws 
\             # Failed: please remove \ from your path 
\.ws          # Failed: please remove \ from your path 
.             # Should create ./workspace.session, ./workspace.viminfo
..            # Should create ../workspace.session, ../workspace.viminfo
/.            # Should create /workspace.session, /workspace.viminfo
/..           # Should create /workspace.session, /workspace.viminfo
./            # Should create ./workspace.session, ./workspace.viminfo
../           # Should create ../workspace.session, ../workspace.viminfo
./.           # Should create ./workspace.session, ./workspace.viminfo
./..          # Should create ../workspace.session, ../workspace.viminfo
../.          # Should create ../workspace.session, ../workspace.viminfo
../..         # Should create ../../workspace.session, ../../workspace.viminfo

/home/not_exist_folder/foo  # Failed: folder not exist.
/not_exist_folder/          # Failed: not have .ws as suffix 
/tmp/.wsxsdf                # Failed: not have .ws as suffix
/tmp/.ws                    # Failed: no name for .ws
/tmp/my.ws                  # Would create /tmp/my.session, /tmp/my.viminfo

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:Loadws                                                              *:Loadws*

Load vim session and viminfo files.

Example 1: >
  :Lavews    
<
Result: Will load workspace.session and workspace.viminfo in current folder 
        if existed. 

Example 2: >
  :Lavews /home/myproject 
<
Result: Will load:
          /home/myproject/workspace.session
          /home/myproject/workspace.viminfo
        Please make sure workspace files existed beforehand.

Example 3: >
  :Lavews my.ws
<
Result: Load my.session and my.viminfo in current folder.

Example 4: >
  :Lavews /home/myproject/my.ws
<
Result: Will load my.session and my.viminfo from /home/myproject folder 
        if workspace files existed.

Just one situation I want to mention here:
If you once run Loadws to load your workspace files, then you run Loadws to 
reload then again, it will not close all openning windows and tabs. 
In other words, you may see double windows have been opened for the same file.

==============================================================================
 5. OPTIONS                                                 *workspaceOptions*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 5.1 Options summary                                 *workspaceOptionsSummary*

|'wsOverwrite'|                  Overwrite existed vim session and viminfo 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 5.2 Options details                                 *workspaceOptionsDetails*

To enable any of the below options you should put the given line in your
~/.vimrc

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               *'wsOverwrite'*
Value: 0 or 1.
Default: 1.

If there are vim session and viminfo files with same name, you can overwrite 
it by setting this option to 1: >
  let g:wsOverwrite=1
<
So, if g:wsOverwrite is 0, and there are workspace.session and 
workspace.viminfo, when you type: >
  :Savews
<
It will said "Workspace files existed, and wsOverwrite is 0, will not 
overwrite existed files."
If g:wsOverwrite is 1, it will overwrite them.

IT RECOMMENDED STRONGLY YOU KEEP IT DEFAULT AS 1.~
BECAUSE IF IT'S 0, WHEN YOU EXIT VIM, IT WON'T SAVE YOUR WORKSPACE FILES~
AUTOMATICALLY.~

==============================================================================
 6. LIMITATION AND KNOWN ISSUES                          *workspaceLimitation*
 
* Windows is not a target of this plugin.
  I think you would experience some problmes if you want to use this plugin on 
  Windows Vim.
* There is compatible problem when work with autochdir option. Recommend to 
  remove autochdir option from your ~/.vimrc.
  For my experiences, if enable autochdir option in Vim, users will mess up 
  themselves when trying to provide relative pathes of Vim session and viminfo 
  files. It seems it can't have impact if you provide absolute path for Vim 
  session and viminfo files.
* There is a little compatible problem in some tty console.
  In some tty console, when launching Vim and this plugin prompt a workspace 
  list for your choice, after you input your choice, it will echo all message 
  one time. Anyway, the function still works.
* You'd better not to run :Loadws in same Vim twice.
  If you once run Loadws to load your workspace files, then run Loadws to reload
  them again in the same Vim, it will not close all openning windows and tabs. 
  In other words, you may see double windows have been opened for the same file.

==============================================================================
 7. CHANGE LOG AND TODO LIST                                   *workspaceTodo*

Below are my change logs with development troubleshooting trace and TODO list.

- [Fixed]When editing files with path, only create session and viminfo files 
  under sub folder.
  For example, you're in /root, editing /root/test/1.txt, then it only create 
  session and viminfo files under /root/test, if you just run Savews.
  
  Root cause:
  Because have "set autochdir" in ~/.vimrc.

  Resolution:
  After reading articles, autochdir would cause some errors for a few plugins.
  So it's better to disable autochdir, instead of it, use a map to do changing
  working directory. 
  And need give warning for users if they have autochdir in ~/.vimrc.
  To check whether use have autochdir, instead of read vimrc, you can get 
  output of 'set autochdir?'. But it's a little difficult to get output 
  of 'set autochdir?', I tried exe and read, only find redir to register can
  work.
  redir @s
  set autochdir?
  redir END
  echo @s

  OK, find a better way:
  you can use &setting to access the value of a vim setting.
  See :help expr-option.
  More detais: I found this way from stackoverflow.com, use vim settings as 
  variables / How to check if specific guioption is set or not.


- [Fixed] I found, once execute Loadws, it will change current directory.
  So I have to save current directory before execute Loadws, then recovery it 
  after execute Loadws. 

- [Fixed] If use source in vimscript, it will remove last echo function, 
  and print a non-sense message.
  For example, if I have a echo "test" before execute "source " . a:sf, I 
  will can't see test been printed to stdout. 
  What's boring is that it still print non-sense message to stdout.

  Tried million ways to redir the non-sense message to other place, faield.
  Finally find!!!! You can use silent before execute!!!!!

- [Done][IMPROVEMENT] Need add autocmd to save session and viminfo files when 
  exitvim otherwise it will not save it.

- [Done][IMPROVEMENT] Need add check to init() to load default workspace files 
  if existed and prompt cur dir's existed session and viminfo files when 
  start vim. 
  There is a little different behavior between real console and tty. When in 
  putty tty, it will echo what you've input. But can't reproduced in real 
  console.

- [No need][IMPROVEMENT] Add map for quick Savews Workspace.session and 
  workspace.viminfo.
  No need for this point. Because we have added support to save session and 
  viminfo files when VimLeave.
