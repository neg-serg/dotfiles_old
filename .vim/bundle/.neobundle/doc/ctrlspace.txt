1. Overview                                                 *ctrlspace-overview*

**Vim-CtrlSpace** is a Vim plugin to control and organize your working space in
Vim. Including managing buffers, files, tabs, sessions, and finally projects.
Its approach is somewhat unique, but certainly you will feel at home,
especially if you use already split windows, tabs, buffers, etc.

You can think of it as a buffer/file/tab explorer mixed with a fuzzy finder
like CtrlP, and a session and project explorer. Pretty wide, isn't it? With
Vim-CtrlSpace you gain a good view of what is open and where it is, together
with good categorization through various lists.

This idea seems to work very well and the plugin may become your coolest
companion. It can help you to manage your Vim workspace and increase your usage
of core Vim features like multiple buffers, tabs, and windows in a great degree.
The plugin can also provide you with some new concepts, like workspaces, named
tabs, or separate buffer lists.

It is worth to say, for many users including myself, Vim-CtrlSpace became
the most important tool in the Vim toolbox and a strong improvement of the
existing workflow.


1.1 The Idea~

Visually, Vim-CtrlSpace is a temporary window that sticks to the bottom of
screen and contains a list (like a menu) from which you can select items.

However, to leverage the most of unique Vim-CtrlSpace approach you should
understand well Vim's concepts of buffers, tab pages, and split windows as they
are quite distinct from other editors.


1.1.1 Buffers, Windows, and Tabs~

The files opened in Vim reside in memory slots called buffers. Buffers are also
used for various special cases by Vim itself and by many plugins. Buffers can be
visible in a list called _buffer list_. You can display them with `:ls` command.
To see also those special unlisted buffers add a bang: `:ls!`. The listed
buffers are usually normal text buffers you are working on whereas those
unlisted ones are special purpose Vim and plugins internals (often automatically
created).

Please also notice, that the buffer list is usually called a tab list in other
editors. In those editors you can have many files opened in separate tabs. In
Vim the buffer list serves in the same way.

A window in Vim is a frame that always displays a buffer. The buffers without
any windows attached are called _hidden_ (since they are invisible at the
moment). A buffer can have many windows attached to it but a window can display
only one buffer at a time. However, in the main application window (let's name
it view or viewport) you can display many windows side by side. Those windows
are then called split ones. This is in fact very handy feature of Vim.

The next important Vim feature are tab pages. In fact they are those viewports
containing split windows. It's like instead of one main app window you can have
a bunch of viewports. And you can switch them easily.

This feature led people to collect groups of split windows with concrete
buffers in viewports. In that way each viewport - tabpage - is in fact a set
of buffers related to some concrete topic.


1.1.2 Vim-CtrlSpace Concept~

The ability of collecting buffers in tab pages is the root of Vim-CtrlSpace
plugin. Split windows are not so good in that role. You can have a finite number
of split windows. Each new window leads to harder navigation. Each new window is
also smaller (thus they split larger windows, right?).

Given with those facts Vim-CtrlSpace provides a solution. In Vim-CtrlSpace, each
tab page, besides being a viewport is also a separate list of buffers.
Technically, each tab page has its own buffer list. In that way, you can easily
split your buffers to number of sublists. You can create new ones, remove them,
move, copy, add and remove items, finally give them meaningful names.

The whole set of lists - tab pages - can be saved permanently as a workspace.
In one project directory you can have plenty of saved workspaces. And again, you
can add new ones, remove, rename them or even merge. Workspaces behaves similar
to Vim sessions.

The last but not least feature is that you can easily navigate between your
favorite projects with bookmarks - a permanent list of your favorite locations
(directory paths). Each project directory contains different workspaces.

Summarizing, in the plugin window you have access to 5 different lists:
Buffer List, File List, Tab List, Workspace List, and Bookmark List.
Each list displays items you can use and modify. Moreover, each list
provides a fuzzy Search Mode to narrow displayed items. Some of lists provides
also various modes depending on context.

Here's the short description of each list:

* Buffer List - displays buffers from current list - tab page. It has also
  a mode to display all available buffers. Buffer List allows you also to
  manipulate windows of the current tab page.
* File List - displays all files of the current project. You can easily find and
  open them, therefore it's shortcut is `o` - for "Open".
* Tab List - displays tab pages - and since they are also separate buffer lists,
  the shortcut here is `l` - for "Lists". You can operate on them as on other
  items. Managing tab pages has never been so easy!
* Workspace List - shows your stored workspaces - sessions for the current
  project (`w`).
* Bookmark List - shows your favorite projects (`b`). You can easily jump to given
  locations. This is extremely useful combined with other lists.

The plugin name follows the convention of naming similar plugins after their
default mappings (like "Command-T" or "CtrlP"). Obviously, the plugin mapping is
by default `Ctrl` `+` `Space`.

If you like the plugin please don't forget to add a star to its GitHub
repository (https://github.com/szw/vim-ctrlspace)! This will help me to
estimate the plugin popularity and that way I will proceed better its further
development :).

If you have starred this repo already, thank you! Thanks to you it's my pet
project now :). If you have a question, a feature request, or a new idea, don't
hesitate to post new issues or pull requests. The collaboration is the most
exciting thing in the open source community.


1.2 Demo~

If you are still a bit unsure whether is it something you should try, here's
a small demonstration. Viewing in HD advised!

There is also an older version available:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09l92uwKupI - a bit more verbose.

The Demo has been recorded with:

- a console Vim 7.4 (Monaco font)
  - a Vim-CtrlSpace plugin v. 4.0.0
- a bit modified Seoul256 color scheme (https://github.com/szw/seoul256.vim)
- following Vim-CtrlSpace settings in .vimrc: >

  hi CtrlSpaceSelected term=reverse ctermfg=187  ctermbg=23  cterm=bold
  hi CtrlSpaceNormal   term=NONE    ctermfg=244  ctermbg=232 cterm=NONE
  hi CtrlSpaceSearch   ctermfg=220  ctermbg=NONE cterm=bold
  hi CtrlSpaceStatus   ctermfg=230  ctermbg=234  cterm=NONE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Getting Started                                   *ctrlspace-getting-started*

The plugin installation is really simple. You can use Vundle or Pathogen, or
just clone the repository to your `.vim` directory. In case of Vundle, add: >

    Plugin 'szw/vim-ctrlspace'
<
to your `.vimrc`.

To improve your overall experience please enable the `hidden` option too: >

    set hidden
<
If you want to increase plugin speed (e.g. fuzzy search), make sure you have
decent Ruby bindings enabled in (compiled into) your Vim. The plugin will try
to use your Ruby by default.


2.1 Colors~

Next you should spend some time on adjusting plugin colors to match your
colorscheme. Please don't leave this step. It's very important to make sure,
the plugin clearly displays the information, but there are so many colorshemes
available for Vim so it's impossible to assure that with defaults. You will
use the plugin window very very often. It's worth to make it eye-candy.

Similarly, the font glyphs used as various symbols might not look well in your
setup. Their rendering depends on many settings, so they are configurable via
|g:ctrlspace_symbols| variable. Don't hesitate to adjust them to meet your
needs.

By default the plugin uses some default settings basing on your active
colorscheme - just in order to display anything. But those default are very far
from perfect. The best way to set the colors is to use `:hi` command (without
anything) and see colors defined already in you colorsheme.

For example, I use Solarized Dark colorscheme both in MacVim and in the terminal
Vim. For terminal (iTerm2) I had to load the Solarized preset first. Then Vim
uses the terminal colors (16). Whereas the Mac Vim uses full HEX values.

In the console Vim and in the MacVim I issued `:hi` and got for example the
following entries for `TabLine`:

MacVim: >

  TabLine xxx term=underline cterm=underline ctermfg=15 ctermbg=8 gui=underline
              guifg=#839496 guibg=#073642 guisp=#839496
<
Console Vim: >

  TabLine xxx term=underline cterm=underline ctermfg=12 ctermbg=0 gui=underline guibg=DarkGrey
<
Basing on that I used the `cterm*` parts from Console Vim and the `gui*` parts
from MacVim to create the Vim-Ctrlspace color definition for Normal background: >

  hi CtrlSpaceNormal guifg=#839496 guibg=#073642 guisp=#839496 gui=NONE ctermfg=12 ctermbg=0 cterm=NONE
<
As you can see, I stripped off the `underline` directive.

In the following way you should define all four Vim-CtrlSpace highlight
definitions: `CtrlSpaceNormal`, `CtrlSpaceSelected`, `CtrlSpaceSearch`, and
`CtrlSpaceStatus`.

If you are curious, here is my full highlight definition set for Solarized Dark
scheme: >

  " Colors of CtrlSpace for Solarized Dark
  " (MacVim and Console Vim under iTerm2 with Solarized Dark theme)

  " Based on Solarized TablineSel
  hi CtrlSpaceSelected guifg=#586e75 guibg=#eee8d5 guisp=#839496 gui=reverse,bold ctermfg=10 ctermbg=7 cterm=reverse,bold

  " Based on Solarized Tabline/TablineFill
  " original Normal
  " hi CtrlSpaceNormal   guifg=#839496 guibg=#073642 guisp=#839496 gui=NONE ctermfg=12 ctermbg=0 cterm=NONE
  " tweaked Normal with darker background in Gui
  hi CtrlSpaceNormal   guifg=#839496 guibg=#021B25 guisp=#839496 gui=NONE ctermfg=12 ctermbg=0 cterm=NONE

  " Based on Title
  hi CtrlSpaceSearch   guifg=#cb4b16 guibg=NONE gui=bold ctermfg=9 ctermbg=NONE term=bold cterm=bold

  " Based on PmenuThumb
  hi CtrlSpaceStatus   guifg=#839496 guibg=#002b36 gui=reverse term=reverse cterm=reverse ctermfg=12 ctermbg=8
<
If you use a popular colorscheme and you would like to share your
settings, I'd love to add them here! Please post a pull request, an issue or
just an email: szymon@wrozynski.com.

If you are a color scheme maker and you use and like Vim-CtrlSpace, perhaps you
could consider to create highlight definitions for the plugin too?


2.2 Status Line~

Vim-CtrlSpace requires a status bar. If you are using a plugin customizing the
status bar this might be a bit tricky. For example "vim-airline"
(https://github.com/bling/vim-airline) plugin might require you to set: `let`
`g:airline_exclude_preview` `=` `1` option and "LightLine"
(https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) will require to use custom status
line segments, provided by Vim-CtrlSpace API.


2.3 Tabline~

Vim-CtrlSpace can set a custom tabline. If the proper option is enabled
(`g:ctrlspace_use_tabline`), the plugin will set a custom tabline for you. The
tabs in that tabline are displayed in the following way (similar format is used
also in the Tab List):

| Format  | Tab number | Buffers | Modified | Buffer or tab name |
| ------- | ---------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| Unicode | `1`          | `²`       | `+`        | `[README.md]`        |
| ASCII   | `1`          | `:2`      | `+`        | `[README.md]`        |


If GUI tabs are detected, this option will also set the proper function to
`guitablabel`.

Notice, that if you intensify your tabs usage, the Vim tabline feature could
become less usable, because of increasing tab number, especially with long
names. And that's where you found the Tab List really usable. You can even
turn off the tabline completely: `set` `showtabline=0` and rely on the Tab List
only. To see Tab List press `l` in the plugin window.


2.4 Project Root~

Some plugin features require a project root to work properly. If you open the
File List for the first time in given Vim's working directory it will try to
find out the possible root directory. First, it starts in the Vim's current
working directory and check if there are so called "root markers". The root
markers are characteristic directories that are available in an exemplary
project root directory, like e.g. `.git` or `.hg` ones. You can define them
yourself in the `g:ctrlspace_project_root_markers` variable. If no markers were
found the plugin will check if perhaps this directory is a known root. The known
roots are those directories you provided (accepted) yourself when no markers
were found. If the current directory cannot be proven as a project root, the
algorithm will repeat the whole procedure in the parent one.

After checking all predecessors it will ask you to provide the root folder
explicitly. After your acceptance that root folder will be stored pemanently in
the `.cs_cache` file as serve as a known root later.

If you add the directory to bookmarks, it will be considered as project root
automatically.


2.5 User Interface~

Vim-CtrlSpace contains 5 different lists: "Buffer List", "File List", "Tab
List", "Workspace List", and "Bookmark List". Some of those have additional
modes. However, in a modal editor like Vim this should not fear you ;).

You can jump between lists easily by pressing one of the following keys:

| Key | Action                                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `o`   | Jump to File List (aka Open List)                      |
| `O`   | Jump to File List (aka Open List) in Search Mode       |
| `l`   | Jump to Tab List                                       |
| `L`   | Jump to Tab List in Search Mode                        |
| `w`   | Jump to Workspace List                                 |
| `W`   | Jump to Workspace List in Search Mode                  |
| `b`   | Jump to Bookmark List                                  |
| `B`   | Jump to Bookmark List in Search Mode                   |

Since the "Buffer List" is the default one, in order to jump to it press one of
those keys again (except `O`, `L`, `W`, or `B`) or just hit `Backspace`.

User interface of the plugin is a list window. Its status line contains
important symbolic information:

| Unicode | ASCII | List        | Description             |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| `⌗`       | `#`     | All         | Vim-CtrlSpace symbol    |
| `?`       | `?`     | All         | Help Mode indicator     |
| `›_‹`     | `[_]`   | All         | Search Mode indicator   |
| `∙`       | `TAB`   | Buffer      | Single Mode indicator   |
| `★`       | `VIS`   | Buffer      | Visible Mode indicator  |
| `፨`       | `ALL`   | Buffer      | All Mode indicator      |
| `⊚`       | `FILE`  | File        | File List indicator     |
| `⁺²`      | `+2`    | Buffer/File | Next Tab Mode indicator |
| `⌕`       | `*`     | Buffer      | Zoom Mode indicator     |
| `○●○`     | `-+-`   | Tab         | Tab List indicator      |
| `|∷|`     | `|::|`  | Workspace   | Workspace Load Mode     |
| `[∷]`     | `[::]`  | Workspace   | Workspace Save Mode     |
| `♥`       | `BM`    | Bookmark    | Bookmark List indicator |

Items listed in the plugin window can have additional indicators (following the
item text):

| Unicode | ASCII | Indicator                         |
| ------- | ----- | --------------------------------- |
| `+`       | `+`     | Item modified                     |
| `★`       | `*`     | Item active                       |
| `☆`       | `-`     | Item visible or previously active |

Those indicators can be configured via |g:ctrlspace_symbols| variable.


2.6 Tab Management~

Tabs in **Vim-CtrlSpace** are considered as lists of related buffers. But of
course, they remain regular Vim tab pages. So they can display the buffers they
carry in split windows, they can be moved, deleted, switched, etc. Moreover, the
plugin lets you to perform many classic tab actions easily in the Buffer List
view and of course in the Tab List (turned on with letter `l`).

You can also rename them - tabs (lists) in Vim-CtrlSpace can be named - or even
copy them! The latter action is useful if you want to split your tab/list into
smaller ones.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Lists                                                       *ctrlspace-lists*

The most inner list is the Buffer List. It stores buffers for the given tab. The
File List is a special case here containing buffers and not opened yet files.
Similarly, the All Mode includes all listed buffers. The Tab List encloses many
Buffer Lists. Workspace List encloses many Tab Lists, and finally the Bookmark
List encloses many Workspace Lists (one per project root).

Here's the graphic illustration of those relations:
https://raw.github.com/szw/vim-ctrlspace/master/gfx/lists.png


3.1 Buffer List                                          *ctrlspace-buffer-list*

This is the basic list of the plugin. Depending of its mode it can collect
buffers from the current tab or all available buffers.


3.1.1 Single Mode                                        *ctrlspace-single-mode*

| Unicode | ASCII |
| ------- | ----- |
| `∙`       | `TAB`   |

The first mode of Buffer List is the Single one. In that mode, the plugin
shows you only buffers related to the current tab (list). Here's the full
listing of all available keys:

| `B`   | Enter the Bookmark List view in Search Mode                       |


3.1.1.10 Workspace shortcuts~

| Key      | Action                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Ctrl` `+` `l` | Load the last active workspace (if present)                  |
| `Ctrl` `+` `s` | Save the current workspace                                   |
| `N`        | Make a new workspace (closes all buffers)                    |


3.1.2 Visible Mode                                      *ctrlspace-visible-mode*

| Unicode | ASCII |
| ------- | ----- |
| `★`       | `VIS`   |

This mode is a variant of the Single Mode narrow to visible buffers only. It is
useful if you want e.g. to jump between windows in the current tab with `Tab` or
`S-Tab` keys.


3.1.3 All Mode                                              *ctrlspace-all-mode*

| Unicode | ASCII |
| ------- | ----- |
| `፨`       | `ALL`   |

This mode is almost identical to the Single Mode, except it shows you all
available buffers (from all tabs and unrelated ones too). Some of keys
presented in the Single Mode are not available here. The missing ones are
`f`, `c`, `{`, `}`, `<`, `>` - as they are connected with current tab.


3.1.4 Zoom Mode                                            *ctrlspace-zoom-mode*

| Unicode | ASCII |
| ------- | ----- |
| `⌕`       | `*`     |

This mode works in a conjunction with the Buffer List. You can invoke the Zoom
Mode by hitting the `z` key. Hitting `z` does almost the same as `Space` - it
shows you the selected buffer, but unlike `Space`, that change of the target
window content is not permanent. However, once turned on - it alters the `Space`
behavior temporarily too. Also, the target window gets maximized to show you
more content of the zoomed buffer. When you quit the plugin window, the old
(previous) content of the target window is restored as well as its original
window size.

Jumps history remains unchanged and the selected buffer won't be added
to the tab buffer list. In that way, you can just preview a buffer before
actually opening it.

You can toggle the Zoom Mode on and off with the `z` key.


3.2 File List                                              *ctrlspace-file-list*

| Unicode | ASCII |
| ------- | ----- |
| `⊚`      | `FILE`  |

This list shows you all files in the project and allows you to open a new file
(as a buffer) in the current tab. Notice, only the project root directory
is considered here in order to prevent you from accidental loading root of i.e.
your home directory, as it would be really time consuming (file scanning) and
rather pointless. If you bookmark a directory - it is taken as a project
root too.

For the first time the file list is populated with data. Sometimes, for a very
large project this could be quite time consuming (I've noticed a lag for
a project with over 2200 files). Also, it depends on files stored for example in
the SCM directory. In the end, the content of the project root directory is
cached and available immediately. All time you can force plugin to refresh the
list with the `r` key.

3.3 Tab List                                                *ctrlspace-tab-list*

Tabs in Vim-CtrlSpace, due to this plugin nature, are used more extensively
than their normal Vim usage. Vim author, Bram Moolenaar in his great talk "7
Habits of Effective Text Editing" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6K4iIMlouI)
stated that if you needed more than 10 tabs then probably you were doing
something wrong. In Vim-CtrlSpace tab pages are great, labelled containers for
buffers, and therefore their usage increases. All it means that sometimes the
default tabline feature used in Vim to organize tab pages is not sufficient.
For example, you might have more tabs (and with wider labels) which don't fit
the tabline width, causing rendering problems.

In the Tab List view you can list all tabs. You can even turn off your tabline
entirely (via Vim's `showtabline` option) and stick to the Tab List only.

3.4 Workspace List                                    *ctrlspace-workspace-list*

| Unicode | ASCII | Mode      |
| ------- | ----- | --------- |
| `|∷|`     | `|::|`  | Load Mode |
| `[∷]`     | `[::]`  | Save mode |

The plugin allows you to save and load so called "workspaces". A workspace is
a set of opened windows, tabs, their names, and buffers. In fact, the word
"workspace" can be considered as a synonym of a "session".

The ability of having so many "sessions" available at hand creates a lot of
interesting use cases! For example, you can have a workspace for each task or
feature you are working on. It's very easy to switch from one workspace to
another, thus this could be helpful with reviewing completed tasks and
continuing work on an item after some period of time. Moreover, you can have
special workspaces that are prepared to be appended to others. Consider, e.g.
a "Config" workspace. Imagine, you have a separate workspace with the only one
tab named "Config" and some config files opened there. You can easily append
that workspace to you current or next ones, depending on your needs. That way
you are able to group the common and repetative sets of files in just one place
and reuse that group in many contexts.

The Workspace List shows you available workspaces. By default this list is
displayed in the "Load Mode". The second available mode is the "Save" one.

Workspaces are saved in a file (`[.]cs_workspaces`) inside the project
directory. Its extact name and path is determined by defined and found project
root markers. By default, the project root marker is taken as the destination
directory.

It's also possible to automatically load the last active workspace on Vim
startup and save it active workspace on Vim exit. See
|g:ctrlspace_load_last_workspace_on_start| and
|g:ctrlspace_save_workspace_on_exit| for more details.

Bookmarks can be treated as a Project list populated with your favorite
projects. With bookmarks you can easily jump between different directory
locations in Vim. The plugin will follow those jumps with its all settings.

In that way inside different projects you will have different file lists,
different workspace lists, etc. Nothing prevents you to mix buffers between
various projects - you can for example, jump to previous project, open
a configuration file, and return to your current stuff with that file open.

It's also worth to mention, that you can still navigate to different places
manually, with the `:cd` command. The plugin will behave in the same way. In
fact, jumping with Bookmark List is just a shortcut for the `:cd` command.

| `Ctrl` `+` `Space`   | Close the list - depending on settings                  |

Besides the entering phase there is also a second state possible. That is the
state of having a search query entered. The successfully entered query behaves
just like a kind of sorting. In fact, it is just a kind of sorting and
filtering function. So it doesn't impact on lists except it narrows the
contents.

It's worth to mention that in that mode the `Backspace` key removes the search
query entirely.


4.2 Nop Mode                                                *ctrlspace-nop-mode*

Nop (Non-Operational) mode happens when i.e. there are no items to show (empty
list), or you are trying to type a Search query, and there are no results at
all. That means the Nop can happen during the "entering phase" of the Search
Mode or in some other cases. Those cases can occur, for example, when you
have only unlisted buffers available in the tab (like e.g. help window and
some preview ones). As you will see, in such circumstances - outside the
entering phase - there is a great number of resque options available.


4.2.1 Nop (entering phase)~

| Key          | Action                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Backspace`    | Remove the previously entered character or clear search |
| `Ctrl` `+` `h`     | Remove the previously entered character or clear search |
| `Ctrl` `+` `w`     | Clear the search phrase                                 |
| `Ctrl` `+` `u`     | Clear the search phrase                                 |
| `Ctrl` `+` `c`     | Close the list                                          |
| `Esc`          | Close the list - depending on settings                  |
| `Ctrl` `+` `Space` | Close the list - depending on settings                  |


4.2.2 Nop (outside the entering phase)~

| Key          | Action                                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `Backspace`    | Delete the search query                              |
| `q`            | Close the list                                       |
| `Ctrl` `+` `c`     | Close the list                                       |
| `Esc`          | Close the list - depending on settings               |
| `Ctrl` `+` `Space` | Close the list - depending on settings               |
| `Q`            | Quit Vim with a prompt if unsaved changes found      |
| `a`            | Toggle between Single and All modes                  |
| `A`            | Enter All mode and switch to Search Mode             |
| `o`            | Toggle the File List (Open List)                     |
| `O`            | Enter the File List (Open List) in Search Mode       |
| `l`            | Toggle the Tab List view                             |
| `L`            | Enter the Tab List view in Search Mode               |

| `W`            | Enter the Workspace List view in Search Mode         |
| `b`            | Toggle the Bookmark List view                        |
| `B`            | Enter the Bookmark List view in Search Mode          |
| `Ctrl` `+` `p`     | Bring back the previous searched text                |
| `Ctrl` `+` `n`     | Bring the next searched text                         |


4.3 Help Mode                                              *ctrlspace-help-mode*

Help Mode is a view showing available keys together with theirs description,
depending on your current list and mode. You can also jump to more detailed
Vim-help with `h`. The navigation works in a similar fashion like in list views.

| Key          | Action                                                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `?`            | Toggle the Help Mode                                     |
| `Backspace`    | Close the Help Mode                                      |
| `h`            | Open Vim help for current list/mode                      |
| `j`            | Move down                                                |
| `k`            | Move up                                                  |
| `J`            | Move to the bottom of the list                           |
| `K`            | Move to the top of the list                              |
| `Ctrl` `+` `f`     | Move one screen down                                     |
| `Ctrl` `+` `b`     | Move one screen up                                       |
| `Ctrl` `+` `d`     | Move a half screen down                                  |
| `Ctrl` `+` `u`     | Move a half screen up                                    |
| `q`            | Close the plugin window                                  |
| `Ctrl` `+` `c`     | Close the plugin window                                  |
| `Esc`          | Close the plugin window - depending on plugin settings   |
| `Ctrl` `+` `Space` | Close the plugin window - depending on plugin settings   |
| `Q`            | Quit Vim with a prompt if unsaved changes found          |


4.4 Next Tab Mode                                      *ctrlspace-next-tab-mode*

| Unicode | ASCII |
| ------- | ----- |
| `⁺²`      | `+2`    |

This mode occurs in File and Buffer Lists. It can be turned on with the
uppercase `T` letter. If the mode is active, the `T` creates the new tab only
once and opens all further files/buffers in that tab. This is opposite to `t`
which opens in a new tab all the time.

The mode indicator shows you the number of buffers opened in the next tab. You
can jump to that tab anytime with `]` key.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Configuration                                       *ctrlspace-configuration*

Vim-CtrlSpace has following configuration options. Almost all of them are
declared as global variables and should be defined in your `.vimrc` file in the
similar form: >

  let g:ctrlspace_foo_bar = 123

<
5.1 *g:ctrlspace_height*

Sets the minimal height of the plugin window.

Default value: `1`


5.2 *g:ctrlspace_max_height*

Sets the maximum height of the plugin window. If `0` provided it uses 1/3 of the
screen height.

Default value: `0`


5.3 *g:ctrlspace_set_default_mapping*

Turns on the default mapping. If you turn this option off (`0`) you will have to
provide your own mapping to the `CtrlSpace` yourself.

Default value: `1`


5.4 *g:ctrlspace_default_mapping_key*

By default, Vim-CtrlSpace maps itself to `Ctrl` `+` `Space`. If you want to
change the default mapping provide it here as a string with valid Vim keystroke
notation.

Default value: `"<C-Space>"`


5.5 *g:ctrlspace_use_ruby_bindings*

If set to `1`, the plugin will try to use your compiled in Ruby bindings to
increase the speed of the plugin (e.g. while fuzzy search, since regex
operations are much faster in Ruby than in VimScript).

To see if you have Ruby bindings enabled you can use the command `:version`
and see if there is a `+ruby` entry. Or just try the following one: >

  :ruby puts RUBY_VERSION

<- you should get the Ruby version or just an error.

Default value: `1`


5.6 *g:ctrlspace_glob_command*

If not empty, the provided command will be used to list all files instead of Vim
|globpath()| function. For example, if you have Ag installed that could be: >

  if executable("ag")
    let g:ctrlspace_glob_command = 'ag -l --nocolor -g ""'
  endif
<
Default value: `""`


5.7 *g:ctrlspace_use_tabline*

Should Vim-CtrlSpace change your default tabline to its own?

Default value: `1`


5.8 *g:ctrlspace_use_mouse_and_arrows_in_term*

Should the plugin use mouse, arrows and `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`
keys in a terminal Vim. Disables the `Esc` key if turned on.

Default value: `0`.


5.9 *g:ctrlspace_save_workspace_on_exit*

Saves the active workspace (if present) on Vim quit. If this option is set,
the Vim quit (`Q`) action from the plugin modes does not check for workspace
changes.

Default value: `0`


5.10 *g:ctrlspace_save_workspace_on_switch*

Saves the active workspace (if present) upon switching to another workspace or
clearing (closing) the current one. If this option is set, the plugin won't warn
you about an unsaved workspace.

Default value: `0`


5.11 *g:ctrlspace_load_last_workspace_on_start*

Loads the last active workspace (if found) on Vim startup.

Default value: `0`


5.12 *g:ctrlspace_cache_dir*

A directory for the Vim-CtrlSpace cache file (`.cs_cache`). By default your
`$HOME` directory will be used.


5.13 *g:ctrlspace_project_root_markers*

An array of directory names which presence indicates the project root. If no
marker is found, you will be asked to confirm the project root basing on the
current working directory. Make this array empty to disable this functionality.

These markes will be also used as a storage for `cs_workspaces` (workspaces of
the current project) and `cs_files` (cached files of the current project).

Default value: `[".git",` `".hg",` `".svn",` `".bzr",` `"_darcs",` `"CVS"]`


5.14 *g:ctrlspace_unicode_font*

Set to `1` if you want to use Unicode symbols, or `0` otherwise.

Default value: `1`


5.15 *g:ctrlspace_symbols*

Enables you to provide your own symbols. It's useful if for example your font
doesn't contain enough symbols or the glyphs are poorly rendered.

Default value: >

  if g:ctrlspace_unicode_font
    let g:ctrlspace_symbols = {
          \ "cs":      "⌗",
          \ "tab":     "∙",
          \ "all":     "፨",
          \ "file":    "⊚",
          \ "tabs":    "○",
          \ "c_tab":   "●",
          \ "load":    "|∷|",
          \ "save":    "[∷]",
          \ "zoom":    "⌕",
          \ "s_left":  "›",
          \ "s_right": "‹",
          \ "bm":      "♥",
          \ "help":    "?",
          \ "iv":      "☆",
          \ "ia":      "★",
          \ "im":      "+",
          \ "dots":    "…"
          \ }
  else
    let g:ctrlspace_symbols = {
          \ "cs":      "#",
          \ "tab":     "TAB",
          \ "all":     "ALL",
          \ "file":    "FILE",
          \ "tabs":    "-",
          \ "c_tab":   "+",
          \ "load":    "|::|",
          \ "save":    "[::]",
          \ "zoom":    "*",
          \ "s_left":  "[",
          \ "s_right": "]",
          \ "bm":      "BM",
          \ "help":    "?",
          \ "iv":      "-",
          \ "ia":      "*",
          \ "im":      "+",
          \ "dots":    "..."
          \ }
  endif


5.16 *g:ctrlspace_ignored_files*

The expression used to ignore some files during file collecting. It is used in
addition to the `wildignore` option in Vim (see |wildignore|). Notice, the
`wildignore` option won't work with a custom glob command
(|g:ctrlspace_glob_command|). And the glob command may ignore some files
itself (for example: `Ag` command obeys `.gitignore` file).

Default value: `'\v(tmp|temp)[\/]'`


5.17 *g:ctrlspace_statusline_function*

Allows to provide custom statusline function used by the CtrlSpace window.

Default value: `"ctrlspace#statusline()"`


5.18 *g:ctrlspace_max_files*

This value specifies how many files will be shown in the plugin window. By
default the limit is set to `500`. Usually there is no reason to show more,
since browsing such big list is rather unconvenient. However, if you want to
disable this feature, set this variable to `0`.

Default value: `500`


5.19 *g:ctrlspace_max_search_results*

Limits the search results. Usually, and especially in large projects, showing
all results is meaningless. It leads to higher time/memory consumption whereas
the far distant results are rather less relevant. By default the results list is
limited to `200` items. You can also limit results to the max plugin window
height by providing value `-1` or you can disable this feature completely by
setting it to `0`.

Default value: `200`


5.20 *g:ctrlspace_search_timing*

Allows you to adjust search smoothness. Contains an array of two integer values.
If the size of the list is lower than the first value, that value will be used
for search delay. Similarly, if the size of the list is greater than the second
value, then that value will be used for search delay. In all other cases the
delay will equal the list size. That way the plugin ensures smooth search
input behavior.

Default value: `[50,` `500]`


5.21 *g:ctrlspace_search_resonators*

Allows you to set characters which will be used to increase search accurancy. If
such "resonator" is found next to the searched sequence, it increases the search
score. For example, consider following files: `zzzabczzz.txt`, `zzzzzzabc.txt`,
and `zzzzz.abc.txt`. If you search for `abc` with default resonators, you will
get the last file as the top relevant item, because there are two resonators
(dots) next to the searched sequence. Next you would get the middle one (one dot
around `abc`), and then the first one (no resonators at all). You can disable
this behavior completely by providing an empty array.

Default value: `['.',` `'/',` `'\',` `'_',` `'-']`


5.22 Colors                                                   *ctrlspace-colors*

The plugin allows you to define its colors entirely. By default it comes with
following highlight links: >

    hi def link CtrlSpaceNormal   Normal
    hi def link CtrlSpaceSelected Visual
    hi def link CtrlSpaceSearch   IncSearch
    hi def link CtrlSpaceStatus   StatusLine
<
You are supposed to tweak its colors (especially CtrlSpaceSearch) on your own,
(in the `.vimrc` file). This can be done as shown below: >

    hi CtrlSpaceSelected term=reverse ctermfg=187  ctermbg=23  cterm=bold
    hi CtrlSpaceNormal   term=NONE    ctermfg=244  ctermbg=232 cterm=NONE
    hi CtrlSpaceSearch   ctermfg=220  ctermbg=NONE cterm=bold
    hi CtrlSpaceStatus   ctermfg=230  ctermbg=234  cterm=NONE
<
The colors defined above can be seen in the demo movie. They fit well the
Seoul256 (https://github.com/junegunn/seoul256.vim) color scheme. If you use a
console Vim the chart from
http://www.calmar.ws/vim/256-xterm-24bit-rgb-color-chart.html might be
helpful.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. API                                                           *ctrlspace-api*


6.1 Commands                                                *ctrlspace-commands*

At the moment Vim-CtrlSpace provides you 8 commands: |:CtrlSpace|,
|:CtrlSpaceGoDown|, |:CtrlSpaceGoUp|, |:CtrlSpaceTabLabel|,
|:CtrlSpaceClearTabLabel|, |:CtrlSpaceSaveWorkspace|, |:CtrlSpaceLoadWorkspace|,
|:CtrlSpaceNewWorkspace|, |:CtrlSpaceAddProjectRoot|,
|:CtrlSpaceRemoveProjectRoot|.


6.1.1 *:CtrlSpace* `[keys]`

Shows the plugin window. It is meant to be used in custom mappings or more
sophisticated plugin integration. You can pass keys that will be "pressed" in the
plugin window.


6.1.2 *:CtrlSpaceGoDown*

Opens the next buffer from the current Single Mode buffer list (without opening
the plugin window).


6.1.3 *:CtrlSpaceGoUp*

Opens the previous buffer from the current Single Mode buffer list (without opening
the plugin window).


6.1.4 *:CtrlSpaceTabLabel*

Allows you to define a custom mapping (outside Vim-CtrlSpace) to change (or
add/remove) a custom tab name.


6.1.5 *:CtrlSpaceClearTabLabel*

Removes a custom tab label.


6.1.6 *:CtrlSpaceSaveWorkspace* [my workspace]

Saves the workspace with the given name. If no name is given then it saves the
active workspace (if present).


6.1.7 *:CtrlSpaceLoadWorkspace* [my workspace]

Loads the workspace with the given name. It has also a banged version
(`:CtrlSpaceLoadWorkspace! my workspace`) which performs appending instead of
loading. If no name is give then it loads (or appends) the active workspace (if
present).


6.1.8 *:CtrlSpaceNewWorkspace*

Closes all opened buffers and eventually opened workspace and leaves only one
tab and one buffer, as in a fresh Vim instance. This is useful if you want to
start creating a workspace from the very beginning.


6.1.9 *:CtrlSpaceAddProjectRoot* [directory]

Add a passed directory as a permanent project root. It's useful when e.g.
project root markers are missing or available on a too higher level of
a hierarchy. If no directory has been passed the current working one is taken
instead.


6.1.10 *:CtrlSpaceRemoveProjectRoot* [directory]

Removes a passed directory from permanent project root collection. If no
directory has been passed the current working one is taken instead.


6.2 Functions                                              *ctrlspace-functions*

Vim-CtrlSpace provides you a couple of functions defined in the common
`ctrlspace` namespace. They can be used for custom status line integration,
tabline integration, or just for more advanced interactions with other plugins.


6.2.1 *ctrlspace#buffers* `(tabnr)`

Returns a dictionary of buffer number and name pairs for given tab. This is the
content of the internal buffer list belonging to the specified tab.


6.2.2 *ctrlspace#bufferlist* `(tabnr)`

Returns a list of buffers available in the given tab. The list is sorted in the
same order like in the CtrlSpace window.


6.2.3 *ctrlspace#statusline_mode_segment* `(...)`

Returns the info about the mode of the plugin. It can take an optional
separator. It can be useful for a custom status line integration (e.g. in
plugins like LightLine (https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim))


6.2.4 *ctrlspace#statusline_tab_segment* `(...)`

Returns the info about the current tab (tab number, label, etc.). It is useful
if you don't use the custom tabline string (or perhaps you have set
|showtabline| to `0` (see |showtabline| for more info)).


6.2.5 *ctrlspace#statusline* `()`

Provides the custom statusline string.


6.2.6 *ctrlspace#tabline* `()`

Provides the custom tabline string.


6.2.7 *ctrlspace#guitablabel* `()`

Provides the custom label for GVim's tabs.


6.2.8 *ctrlspace#tab_buffers_number* `(tabnr)`

Returns formatted number of buffers belonging to given tab. Formats the output
as small Unicode characters (upper indexes) or regular ASCII number characters
(depending on Vim-CtrlSpace unicode settings). It is helper function useful if
you provide your custom tabline function implementation.


6.2.9 *ctrlspace#tab_title* `(tabnr,` `bufnr,` `bufname)`

A helper function returning a consistent title for given tab. If the tab does
not have a custom title, then the title based on passed buffer number
and buffer name is returned instead.


6.2.10 *ctrlspace#tab_modified* `(tabnr)`

Returns `1` if given tab contains a modified buffer, `0` otherwise.

6.2.11 *ctrlspace#bufnr* `()`

Returns the current plugin buffer number if the plugin is visible or
`-1` otherwise.
