INTRODUCTION			*Vital.ProcessManager-introduction*

*Vital.ProcessManager* is a Vim's process manager library, powered by
|vimproc|.  This manager stores external processes ran by this library, and
provide higher layer synchronous non-blocking read/write interface.

Note that this library doesn't work on Vim without vimproc; vimproc is
required.

MEMO
* touch is almost idempotent
* read's out split needs \r as well for windows

==============================================================================
PRINCIPLE			*Vital.ProcessManager-principle*

* Nonblocking
  * blocking APIs should have verbose name to discourage developers to use
* Synchronous (asynchronous in Vim always makes trouble)
* Don't show lower layer too much easily, but don't hide completely. No
  perfect abstraction exists in the world.
* Avoid tricky specification. Function name and behaviour itself should
  explain what it does.
