KEY MAPPINGS					*wwwsearch-key-mappings*

OPERATORS					*wwwsearch-operators*

The following operators are only available if you have installed
|operator-user|.   http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2692

<Plug>(operator-wwwsearch)			*<Plug>(operator-wwwsearch)*
			Search a specified text with

==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZING					*wwwsearch-customizing*

ADD NEW SEARCH ENGINE			     *wwwsearch-add-new-search-engine*

For example, you can search articles in Wikipedia with the following URI:

	http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search={keyword}

To |:Wwwsearch| with Wikipedia, add the following lines in your |vimrc|:
>
	call wwwsearch#add(
	\   'wikipedia',
	\   'http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search={keyword}'
	\ )
<
Then you can search Wikipedia with the following command:
>
	:Wwwsearch -wikipedia vim
<

DEFAULT SEARCH ENGINE			     *wwwsearch-default-search-engine*

By default, |:Wwwsearch| uses Google if you don't specify which search engine
to use.  You can customize the default search engine as follows:
>
	call wwwsearch#default(
	\   'default',
	\   'http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search={keyword}'
	\ )
<
In other words, the search engine named "default" is used as the default
search engine.

					    *wwwsearch-default-search-engines*
By default, the following {search-engine}s are available:

{search-engine}	Search with?
---------------	-----------------------	~
-default	Same as "-google"
-dictionary	Dictionary (Mac OS X only)
-google		Google
-twitter	Twitter
-vim.org	Google for www.vim.org
-wikipedia	Wikipedia


CHANGE THE WEB BROWSER TO SEARCH	 *wwwsearch-your-favorite-web-browser*

Use |g:wwwsearch_command_to_open_uri| to change the web browser to search.
For example, add the following line in your |vimrc|:
>
	let g:wwwsearch_command_to_open_uri = '{path-to-web-browser} {uri}'
<
You have to replace {path-to-web-browser} with a real path to your favorite
web browser.


g:wwwsearch_command_to_open_uri		     *g:wwwsearch_command_to_open_uri*
	A string which specifies the command to open a URI.  In this value,
	{uri} is replaced with a real URI whenever the command is executed.

	{uri} is always replaced with a quoted value.  You don't have to quote
	it to escape meta characters.

	Default value:
	  For Mac OS X:
	    "open {uri}"
	  For Microsoft Windows:
	    "start rundll32 url.dll,FileProtocolHandler {uri}"
	  For other environments:
	    "xdg-open {uri}"




==============================================================================
EXAMPLES					*wwwsearch-examples*

(A) One of the most useful command of Vim is * (|star|).  You want a command
like * to search WWW for a keyword under the cursor.  You can make such
command as follows:
>
	nnoremap <Space>*  :<C-u>Wwwsearch -default <cword><Return>
<
