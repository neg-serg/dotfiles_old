                A semi-automatic, prefix-operated                    
                          LaTeX ftplugin                               
                     with lots of firepower!

    TeX 9 is a ftplugin that aims to enhance the writing experience of high
    quality documents with LaTeX and Vim. The goal of TeX 9 is to be simple
    and Vimish, meaning that focus is on carefully thought-out key mappings
    and features that are already present in a typical Vim installation. If
    you need to write a thesis or research articles and insist on having only
    one editor for all editing tasks, then TeX 9 is for you!
    
    TeX 9 uses Python2.x as its backend and therefore a Vim installation with
    Python support is required. TeX 9 is being developed on Arch Linux running
    Vim 7.3.

     The main features of TeX 9 are
        * Compile, debug and launch a document viewer from within Vim
        * Insert LaTeX code snippets with ease
        * Powerful text-object for LaTeX environments 
        * Omni-completion of BibTeX database entries and label references
        * Omni-completion of mathematical symbols
        * SyncTeX support (only with the Evince document viewer)
        * Filetype specific indentation (courtesy of Johannes Tanzler)
        * LaTeX2e manual (ported to Vim by Mikolaj Machowski)
        * No-hassle settings, relatively few mappings

    Shoutouts
        * Carl Mueller, this ftplugin was inspired by his `auctex.vim' script
        * Vim-LaTeX people Srinath Avadhanula, Mikolaj Machowski and Benji Fisher

==============================================================================

1.  Installation                                    *tex_nine-installation*

    TeX 9 is distributed as a gzipped tarball. Unzip it to your local
    runtime path, usually `~/.vim/'. All TeX 9 specific files referred
    in this help file are located under `ftplugin/TeX_9'.

    Note! In your vimrc, it's mandatory to set `g:tex_flavor' to the
    compiler you wish to use or otherwise TeX 9 might not be loaded
    at all. Other settings you may want to tweak are:

    g:tex_viewer  
        *   Vim dictionary with entries 'app' and 'target'.
        *   Default: {'app': 'xdg-open', 'target': 'pdf'}

    g:tex_bibfiles
        *   Vim list that enumerates the BibTeX databases you want to use
        *   You need only to specify the name of your database if the file 
            resides under a valid texmf tree, i.e. under
            `$TEXMFHOME/bibtex/bib/', or in the compilation folder.
            You may also specify the absolute path.
        *   Default: Disabled

    g:tex_verbose
        *   Boolean
        *   If set to 1, TeX 9 doesn't attempt to filter irrelevant
            warning messages that LaTeX compilers produce. Error messages
            are gathered in a ||quickfix|| list that you may access by
            typing <LocalLeader>Q in normal mode.
        *   Default: Error messages are filtered.

    g:tex_synctex
        *   Boolean
        *   If set to 1, TeX 9 hooks the current Vim buffer to an Evince
            window and you can highlight the current Vim position in Evince
            and vice versa.
        *   See |tex_nine-synctex| for details
        *   Default: Disabled

    Example vimrc for old school latex users: >

        let g:tex_flavor = 'latex'
        let g:tex_viewer = {'app': 'xdvi', 'target': 'dvi'}
<
    Another one for a XeLaTeX user that has multiple BibTeX databases: >

        let g:tex_flavor = 'xelatex'
        let g:tex_bibfiles = ['main.bib', '~/thesis/ad_hoc.bib']
<
    Before you start typesetting documents, you may want to customize
    the document template file `tex_skeleton.tex' in the `skeleton'
    directory.  The file `tex_skeleton.tex.xelatex' shows the skeleton file
    that the author is currently using.

    Finally, should you want to disable TeX 9 temporarily, put this in your
    vimrc: >

        au BufReadPre *.tex let b:init_tex_nine = 1
<

==============================================================================

2.  Basics                                          *tex_nine-basics*

    Press <F1> in an empty LaTeX file to insert a skeleton of a document.
    Almost all other TeX 9 mappings are prefixed with |maplocalleader| that
    defaults to semi-colon, ';'. Typing `;a' would result in `\alpha' for
    instance. See |tex_nine-mappings| below for a complete listing. To insert
    the actual character that <LocalLeader> was set to, type
    <LocalLeader><LocalLeader>.

    The following mappings get you going in insert mode. Type <LocalLeader>C
    to insert a citation, i.e. `\cite{citekey}'. You're prompted with a popup
    list of completions if you set `g:tex_bibfiles'. References, `\ref{ref}',
    work in a similar way. The corresponding mapping is <LocalLeader>R. When
    typesetting an equation or the like, try out the catch-all math completion
    by typing <LocalLeader>M. You can also start the math completion by typing
     anywhere in a partially written math symbol macro. See ||compl-omni||
    for more details about omni-completion.

    To insert an environment, press <LocalLeader>B. You're prompted for an
    environment name and if a corresponding LaTeX code snippet was defined, it
    is inserted into the file. Should you forget the name of a standard LaTeX
    command, type <LocalLeader>K for dictionary completion, or should you need
    advice on LaTeX, consult the LaTeX2e manual with `:help latex'.

    The following mappings work in normal mode. <LocalLeader>k, `small
    compile', compiles your document once and doesn't bother about references;
    <LocalLeader>K, `big compile', calls additionally bibtex and should get
    the cross-references right. You're informed about potential errors: to go
    over them open the ||quickfix|| list with <LocalLeader>Q. Typing
    <LocalLeader>V should open the document in your system's default PDF
    viewer, if you didn't set `g:tex_viewer' to something else.

    To make these mappings work in a LaTeX project with multiple 
    files, please indicate the relative location of the master file in the
    \include-ed files with a modeline of the form
>
    % mainfile: MASTER_FILE
<
    where MASTER_FILE could be for example `../main.tex' if the current file
    is located in a subdirectory of the actual compilation folder. The
    modeline may appear in the three first or three last lines of the
    document.

==============================================================================

3.  Snippets                                        *tex_nine-snippets*

    When you want to insert a LaTeX snippet with <LocalLeader>B, notice that
    the input prompt is <Tab>-completable. Your input is matched against words
    in `dictionaries/tex_dictionary.txt'. Once entered, the name of the
    environment is matched against keywords in the file
    `snippets/tex_snippets.snippets'. Matching snippets are inserted.
    Otherwise TeX 9 inserts a generic environment in LaTeX manuscripts and
    raises an error in BibTeX files.
    >
        % Generic environment
        \begin{keyword}

        \end{keyword}
<
    You may extend the snippet file with your own environments and you will
    notice that the syntax bears resemblance with Michael Sander's snipMate
    plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540). TeX 9
    leaves the <Tab> key untouched so that you may still resort to snipMate if
    you so prefer. If your custom environments is not included in
    `tex_dictionary.txt', append it there. >
            
        :cd ~/.vim/ftplugin/TeX_9/dictionaries
        :!echo 'new_environment' >> tex_dictionary.txt
<
==============================================================================

4.  BibTeX                                          *tex_nine-bibtex*

    In addition to citekey completion, TeX 9 provides a couple of features
    that make it easier to work with BibTeX and LaTeX files in the same Vim
    session. You may take a quick peek at a particular BibTeX entry by
    pressing `gb' over its citekey, i.e. \cite{citekey}. This command is in
    line with ||gd|| and  |gf| with the exception that the BibTeX entry is
    shown in a  |preview-window||.

    You may add new databases on the fly by redefining `g:tex_bibfiles' and
    pressing <LocalLeader>U in normal mode. This mapping updates the citekey
    list that TeX 9 uses for completion. Remember to redefine the
    `\bibliography' command accordingly. TeX 9 doesn't bother to check it at
    all to avoid problems when viewing others' LaTeX manuscripts.

==============================================================================

5.  SyncTeX                                         *tex_nine-synctex*

    If you have set g:tex_synctex, you can Ctrl-click a line in Evince
    (http://projects.gnome.org/evince) and see the corresponding line
    highlighted in Vim. This is called forward searching. Backward searching
    works similarly: you select a cursor position in Vim and click
    <C-LeftMouse> on the position. The correct line should then be highlighted
    in Evince. SyncTeXing from included files works too, but remember to set
    the modeline to the correct master file (see ||tex_nine-basics|| ).

    The requirements for SyncTeX support are: dbus-python and a Vim
    installation _without_ a python3 interpreter. The feature is known to work
    correctly with Evince 3.4 and TeXLive 2011.24722.

==============================================================================

6.  Mappings                                        *tex_nine-mappings*

    <LocalLeader> is semi-colon by default. Change the value of
    'maplocalleader' in `ftplugin/TeX_9/tex_nine_common.vim' to suit your
    taste.

6.1 Insert mode >

        <LocalLeader><LocalLeader>          <LocalLeader>
        <LocalLeader>K                      Dictionary completion
        <LocalLeader>M                      Maths completion

6.4 Extras

    TeX 9 comes with a custom `environment operator' (see ||text-objects||).
    Press 'vie' or 'vae' in normal normal to highlight the current inner
    environment (without the \begin and \end statements) or the outer
    environment respectively. Replace 'v' with another operator to achieve
    yanking, changing or deleting etc. For example, typing 'dae' makes it
    trivial to move figures and tables around in the document. Delete the
    environment, find a new location and paste it back to the buffer!
    
    There are also some convenient macros. Type '^^' to insert '^{}', '__' to
    insert '_{}', '~~' to insert '\approx' and '==' to insert aligned equation
    sign '&='. 

    Finally, try omni-completion () inside curly braces when you're
    including a picture with `\includegraphics{}' or when you're setting your
    font with the `fontspec' package, e.g. `\setmainfont{}'. You'll get a
    listing of pictures in the compilation folder in the first case and a list
    of installed font on your system in the latter. Supported picture formats
    are EPS, PDF, JPG and PNG.

7.  Tips and trick                                  *tex_nine-tips*

7.1     Extending TeX 9: Custom template files

        You can create your own macros/mappings and enable them by placing
        them in a file that is located in the ftplugin directory and whose
        filename is prefixed with `tex', e.g. `~/.vim/ftplugin/tex_foobar.vim'. 

        You may, for example, create more template files for different
        documentclasses and insert them in your manuscripts with a mapping.

        Define the path to your custom template file in the file of your
        choice. >

                let b:mytemp = 'path/to/it/skeleton.tex'
<
        and map <F2> for instance to do the insertion in normal mode. >
                
                noremap <buffer> <F2> :call tex_nine#Insert_skeleton(b:mytemp)<CR>

7.2     Extending TeX 9: Shortcuts for snippets

        Similarly, you may want to create shortcuts for snippet insertion if
        you don't want to use <LocalLeader>B all the time.

        An example for mapping <F1> to insert an equation snippet: >
                
                inoremap <buffer><expr> <F1> tex_nine#Insert_snippet('equation')
<
        If you come up with something sweet, please drop me a line (email
        address behind a reCAPTCHA in the README file.).

7.3     Spell checking

        If you've enabled 'modeline', you may conveniently activate spell
        checking in your LaTeX documents by editing the modeline in the
        skeleton file.

        Example for anglophones: >

                % vim:tw=66 sw=2 ft=tex spell spelllang=en
<
        Notice that newer versions of Vim provide an option >

                let g:tex_comment_nospell= 1

<       for disabling spell checking of comments that otherwise get messed up
        pretty badly.

7.4     Folding

        With newer versions of Vim it's easy as >

                let g:tex_fold_enabled = 1
<
7.5     Alternate command line switches 
        
        By default, TeX 9 compiles your document with the following command:
>
            g:tex_flavor [-synctex=1] -file-line-error -interaction=nonstopmode %
<
        If you need to specify some other switches on the fly, compile your
        document with Vim's |make| command. An example when a LaTeX package
        needs to call external applications:
>
            :silent make! -shell-escape %:p
<
