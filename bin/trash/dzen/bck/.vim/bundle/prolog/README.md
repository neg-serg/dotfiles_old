# Prolog integration for Vim

Prolog is lacking any sort of functional IDE, besides maybe the Emacs-integration that comes with SWI and Sicstus. Vim has traditionally not been a good editor for Prolog. In fact, it is close to being nothing more than a plain text editor for Proolg.

These files seek to change this. Copy them into your `$VIM_RUNTIME` or just `~/.vim`, preserving the directory structure.

The files are public domain so far.

## Feature Highlights

- Accounts for pretty much all of Prolog syntax (including DCGs)
- Syntactical hints for folding
- Accounts for the full set of ISO built-in predicates and operators
- Also features the full set of SWI built-ins.
- gorgeous fruit-salad-fu for your Prolog
