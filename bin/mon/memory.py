# Try to determine how much RAM is currently being used per program.
# Note per _program_, not per process. So for example this script
# will report RAM used by all httpd process together. In detail it reports:
# sum(private RAM for program processes) + sum(Shared RAM for program processes)
# The shared RAM is problematic to calculate, and this script automatically
# selects the most accurate method available for your kernel.

# V1.0      06 Jul 2005     Initial release
# V1.1      11 Aug 2006     root permission required for accuracy
# V1.2      08 Nov 2006     Add total to output
#                           Use KiB,MiB,... for units rather than K,M,...
# V1.3      22 Nov 2006     Ignore shared col from /proc/$pid/statm for
#                           2.6 kernels up to and including 2.6.9.
#                           There it represented the total file backed extent
# V1.4      23 Nov 2006     Remove total from output as it's meaningless
#                           (the shared values overlap with other programs).
#                           Display the shared column. This extra info is
#                           useful, especially as it overlaps between programs.
# V1.5      26 Mar 2007     Remove redundant recursion from human()
# V1.6      05 Jun 2007     Also report number of processes with a given name.
#                           Patch from riccardo.murri@gmail.com
# V1.7      20 Sep 2007     Use PSS from /proc/$pid/smaps if available, which
#                           fixes some over-estimation and allows totalling.
#                           Enumerate the PIDs directly rather than using ps,
#                           which fixes the possible race between reading
#                           RSS with ps, and shared memory with this program.
#                           Also we can show non truncated command names.
# V1.8      28 Sep 2007     More accurate matching for stats in /proc/$pid/smaps
#                           as otherwise could match libraries causing a crash.
#                           Patch from patrice.bouchand.fedora@gmail.com
# V1.9      20 Feb 2008     Fix invalid values reported when PSS is available.
#                           Reported by Andrey Borzenkov <arvidjaar@mail.ru>
# V2.4      06 Mar 2011

# Notes:
#
# All interpreted programs where the interpreter is started
# by the shell or with env, will be merged to the interpreter
# (as that's what's given to exec). For e.g. all python programs
# starting with "#!/usr/bin/env python" will be grouped under python.
# You can change this by using the full command line but that will
# have the undesirable affect of splitting up programs started with
# differing parameters (for e.g. mingetty tty[1-6]).
#
# For 2.6 kernels up to and including 2.6.13 and later 2.4 redhat kernels
# (rmap vm without smaps) it can not be accurately determined how many pages
# are shared between processes in general or within a program in our case:
# http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/6/250
# A warning is printed if overestimation is possible.
# In addition for 2.6 kernels up to 2.6.9 inclusive, the shared
# value in /proc/$pid/statm is the total file-backed extent of a process.
# We ignore that, introducing more overestimation, again printing a warning.
# Since kernel 2.6.23-rc8-mm1 PSS is available in smaps, which allows
# us to calculate a more accurate value for the total RAM used by programs.
#
# Programs that use CLONE_VM without CLONE_THREAD are discounted by assuming
# they're the only programs that have the same /proc/$PID/smaps file for
# each instance.  This will fail if there are multiple real instances of a
# program that then use CLONE_VM without CLONE_THREAD, or if a clone changes
# its memory map while we're checksumming each /proc/$PID/smaps.
#
# I don't take account of memory allocated for a program
# by other programs. For e.g. memory used in the X server for
# a program could be determined, but is not.
#
# FreeBSD is supported if linprocfs is mounted at /compat/linux/proc/
# FreeBSD 8.0 supports up to a level of Linux 2.6.16
