SPECIAL THANKS TO: #
####################
* Jakub 'jimmac' Steiner, Andreas Nilsson, Lapo Calamandrei, Hylke Bons and all
  the other talented artists who make tons of incredible artwork for Linux.
  GNOME-Colors would not exist at all without these people.

* The GNOME and Tango projects, on which GNOME-Colors is decidedly and
  admittedly based 99% on.

* Benjamin Drung and Andrew Starr-Bochicchio for doing the Debian/Ubuntu
  packaging, maintaining the official PPA repository, getting all the packages
  into Ubuntu Karmic's archives, and helping to resolve all licensing conflicts
  in order to make GNOME-Colors freer and easier than ever!

* Benjamin Drung, once again, for engineering the entire move to SVN, the
  creation of makefiles and all the other scripts that allow for automatic
  recoloring.

* Evgeni Golov for reviewing the packages and uploading everything to Debian.

* The Tango Generator project for making dozens of consistent and beautiful
  application icons available for use.

* The developers of "Human" and "Erectus" icon themes for some inspiration and
  icons.

* The Elementary project for being a big influence for GNOME-Colors in the
  project's very early stages. We have moved quite far away from them and into
  almost all Gnome/Tango-based icons, but there are still a small handful of
  icons based on Elementary that give the project a little extra style.

* Many unnamed artists who created or helped create icons specifically for this
  set. (If you are such a person, e-mail me and I will add you here.)

* The gnome-look.org, ubuntuforums.org and linux communities for their constant
  support, words of encouragement and prompt feedback.

* The developers of gnome-do for featuring gnome-colors in their website!

* Xubuntu, Easy Peasy, Sabayon-GNOME, Linux Mint and others for including these
  icons in their distributions!

* The Comix developer for making one of the best applications for Linux, and for
  collaborating in the creation and inclusion of the new Comix logo/icons.

* And last but not least, people who have donated to the project! I don't
  require nor force donations, but I am always very thankful of those of you who
  have donated any amount to the project.
