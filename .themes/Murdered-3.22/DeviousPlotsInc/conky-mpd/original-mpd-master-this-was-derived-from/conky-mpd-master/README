conky-mpd
=========

Small conky setup that displays the current playing song info and cover art on the desktop. It fetches the covers from Last.fm and has a cache function.

USAGE: copy cover.sh, case.png and nocover.png to ~/.conky/conky-mpd and conkyrc-mpd to ~/.conky. Change the APIKEY variable in cover.sh to your own Last.fm API key.

conkyrc-mpd is based on the "Conky panel and MPD cover art" by SuNjACk94 (see http://sunjack94.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d2jvuuh)
