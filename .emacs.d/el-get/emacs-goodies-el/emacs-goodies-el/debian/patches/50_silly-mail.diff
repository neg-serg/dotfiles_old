 ;;; Commentary:
 
-;; To use this, put the following in your .emacs:
+;; To use this, invoke `M-x sm-add-random-header' from a mail composition
+;; buffer to insert a random header.  You may call the command again to
+;; substitute the inserted header by another.
+;;
+;; Use 'M-x sm-delete-last-header' to remove it.
+;;
+;; If you wish all mail messages to have a randomly chosen header, put the
+;; following in your .emacs:
 ;;
 ;;    (autoload 'sm-add-random-header "silly-mail" nil t)
 ;;    (add-hook 'mail-setup-hook 'sm-add-random-header)
+;;    (add-hook 'mh-letter-mode-hook 'sm-add-random-header)
+;;
+;;  or alternatively customize the variable `sm-add-ramdom-header-to-mail'.
+;;
+;; To setup menu-bar entries in sendmail and MH-E menus, customize the
+;; variable `sm-add-menu-bar-entries'.  This has the disadvantage of
+;; loading this library at Emacs startup, so might not be a good choice if
+;; you rarely use silly-mail.
+;;
+;; You may customize silly-mail using `M-x customize-group [RET] silly-mail'.
+;; The following are customizable:
+;;
+;;  - The list of header types used in the random selection by
+;;    `sm-add-random-header'
+;;  - Individual quotes may be disabled from the pool if some are offensive
+;;    to you.
+;;  - Whether all headers use an "X-" prefix or not.
 
 ;; I solicit more randomly generated headers commands.
 
 ;; Some of the options in this program require some external packages which
-;; are not a standard part of emacs, e.g. shop.el and flame.el (flame.el is

+;;; History:
+;; 
+;;  2003-11-25 Peter S Galbraith <psg@debian.org>
+;;
+;;  - Added custom support.  I had to change quote variables from vectors
+;;    to lists to use the `set' custom type, but this had no impact on the
+;;    code.  I also had to change the format of the `sm-mail-header-table'
+;;    variable (leading to a minor change in `sm-use-header-function-p').
+;;    The variable `sm-mail-header-table' is not generated when the variable
+;;    `sm-mail-header-used' customization is set.
+;;  - Made `sm-add-random-header' replace the inserted header if called a
+;;    second time.
+;;  - Added `sm-delete-last-header'.
+;;  - Added optional "X-" prefix for those headers that didn't have them.
+;;  - Added custom variables `sm-add-ramdom-header-to-mail' and
+;;    `sm-add-menu-bar-entries'
+
 ;;; Code:
 
-(require 'sendmail)
+;; Try without requiring sendmail, as byte-compilations fails if
+;; /usr/bin/mail doesn't exist (Closes: #434104)
