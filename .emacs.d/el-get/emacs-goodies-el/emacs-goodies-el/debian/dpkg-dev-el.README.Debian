  This file is an introductory starter for the various goodies included in
dpkg-dev-el.  It does not intend to replace reading the documentation that
is made available in the files themselves (or not available at all, except
insofar as code is self-documenting).

To customize all files in this package, use:

 M-x customize-group [RET] dpkg-dev-el [RET]

Introduction to files in dpkg-dev-el
------------------------------------

debian-bts-control.el provides an interface for composing email messages to
the Debian BTS control interface (control@bugs.debian.org).  Tab completions
works for all possible commands and their options.

debian-changelog-mode.el provides a mode for editing debian/changelog
files.  This mode adds colouring, a few commands to manipulate
changelog entries and bug reports, and a nice filling function.  This
mode can also be used to add colours to buffers visiting the
changelogs in /usr/share/doc/<package>/changelog.Debian files.

debian-copyright.el provides a mode for editing debian/copyright files.
This mode adds a bit of colouring and if `goto-addr' is loaded, it will
make the URLs clickable.

debian-control-mode.el provides a mode for editing debian/control
files.  This mode adds a bit of colouring, a working filling function
(bound to "M-q" by default), tab-completion for adding fields (bound
to "C-c C-a" by default), and viewing bugs (bound to "C-c C-b").

readme-debian.el provides readme-debian-mode, a major mode to
highlight README.Debian files.
