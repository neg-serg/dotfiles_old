# devscripts.el requires apel to be byte-compiled before it can be
# byte-compiled itself.  This could easily go wrong, as shown in
# bug#737202; there, emacs23 did the byte compiling of all installed
# packages when a new version of emacs23 was being configured, but it
# had not yet byte-compiled apel when it attempted to compile
# devscripts-el.  So we skip the byte-compilation of devscripts-el if
# apel has not yet been byte-compiled; this is a workaround for the
# emacs bug which has been uncovered by this.
