emacs-goodies-el (35.11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Complete dpatch -> quilt transition from 31.7 by removing dpatch code
    from debian/patch/* files
  * Quieten lintian warnings by removing executable bits from almost all
    files
  * Include make-orig.sh in source distribution (cvs-buildpackage does
    this anyway)
  * vm-bonus-el package removed - it's ancient and barely used anymore
  * Remove gnus-bonus-el from the source package (the binary package was
    removed in 35.6).  This closes the bugs against it, even though they
    have not been fixed (Closes: #570276, #448441, #236919, #597035,
    #609698, #648607)
  * Fix piuparts error with a temporary patch, until emacsen-common (or
    whatever the true source of the bug is) is fixed. (Closes: #737202)
  * Add emacsen compat files (in line with new policy and current
    debhelper behaviour)
  * Rewrite rules to use nice debhelper stuff; have explicity quilt
    build-dependency
  * Rewrite copyright files to use DEP-5/copyright-format-1.0
  * Update Standards-Version

  * New binary package: devscripts-el.  It currently includes
    devscripts.el and readme-debian.el, both at version 0.0.20021016.
  * Also changed the build process a bit: *.emacsen-install and
    *.emacsen-remove files are now built from *.in files.  Since most of
    the files are identical save for the package name and a few other
    variables at the beginning, let's put that shared code into a separate
    unique file.
  * Added sys-apropos.el (no version, taken at 2002-10-17).

    changelog file.  Search for the "4-merged-gnus-bonus-el" string to get
    to its beginning.
  * While I was at it, I created a new package, emacs-goodies-extra-el, so
    that interesting files with extra dependencies can still be included.
    Beware, this package is likely to have a growing list of dependencies.
    But that also means that I'm going to start accepting files with
    external dependencies into this source package (under the condition
    that they be available as Debian packages in the "main" section).
  * emacs-goodies-extra-el: added dict.el (1.25).
