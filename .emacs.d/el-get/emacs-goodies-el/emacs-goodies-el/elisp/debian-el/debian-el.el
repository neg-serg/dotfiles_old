  "Return coding system for the \"control\" file in a deb.
This function is for use from `file-coding-system-alist'.

ARG-LIST is arguments passed to `find-operation-coding-system'.
The only operation handled here is `insert-file-contents' with a
buffer filename \".deb-INFO!./control\", for which the return is
'utf-8, and for anything else the return is nil (letting
`find-operation-coding-system' try other things).

This is done as a function because the filename passed to
find-operation-coding-system by tar-mode is merely the archive
member \"./control\".  By looking at the buffer-file-name we can
tell if it's from a deb.

Note: This only works in emacs22, in emacs21 or xemacs21 tar-mode
does something a bit different and doesn't reach here (and
there's no buffer passed to coding system functions)."
