This is a checklist for adding files to the emacs-goodies-el package.

- Make sure the upstream file can be used and customized using only the
  custom interface.  Users should not have to edit ~/.emacs themselves.

- copy the file to elisp/emacs-goodies-el/ and add them to CVS.

  $ cvs add elisp/emacs-goodies-el/minibuf-electric.el
  $ cvs commit -m "New files."  elisp/emacs-goodies-el/minibuf-electric.el

- When files are maintained by us, do it in CVS.
  When files have an upstream maintainer, submit patches upstream.  If not
  responsive, handle them by creating a new "quilt" patch in debian/patches.

- Make sure all interactive commands that are entry points into the file
  have autoload cookies.

 (This following step is no longer done, as the emacs-goodies-loaddefs.el
  file is generated at install time now:
#
#  Update the `emacs-goodies-loaddefs.el' file by running:
#
#  $ debian/rules patch
#  $ cd elisp/emacs-goodies-el
#  $ sh emacs-goodies-loaddefs.make 
#  $ cd -
#  $ debian/rules unpatch
 )

- Update `emacs-goodies-custom.el' by adding a modified copy of the file's
  defgroup.  Add lines for `:load' and a `:group 'emacs-goodies-el'.

- Add whatever required startup and setup code that doesn't fit in the
  above files to `emacs-goodies-el.el'.  This gets loaded at Emacs startup.

- Add documentation in alphabetical order to `emacs-goodies-el.texi'
  Then from the Texinfo menu, invoke `Update Every Node' and
  `Create Master Menu'.  Then fill-in a description in the top menu for the
  added entry.

  Test it:

    mkdir info
    makeinfo emacs-goodies-el
    info -f info/emacs-goodies-el
    rm -fR info

Debian Files

Testing the Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 $ ./make-orig.sh
 $ cd ../build_25.1-1/emacs-goodies-el
 $ fakeroot debian/rules binary
  or
 $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot


Releasing the package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Set the distribution to "unstable"
 - See "Testing the Package" to build.
 - Tag the files in CVS, e.g. for version 25.1-1 :

   $ cvs tag debian_version_25_1-1
