Copyright (C) 2012, Free Software Foundation, Inc.

This file contains news for CEDET 1.1 starting after 
     CEDET 1.0 (released 2010-08-27).


* Support for Android Development

** common/cedet-android.el - New support for calling android SDK utilities,
including adb, android, and ddms.

** ede/ede-android.el - New support for detecting android projects,
including support for compilation, debugging, AndroidManifest, and
installing projects on a device.

** srecode/srecode-android.el - New support for android looksups

** srecode/templates/android-java.srt - 


* Support for Arduino Development

** ede/ede-arduino.el - Project support for Arduino sketches.
Includes support for automatic compilation and uploading of projects.

** arduino-mode: supported as a sub-mode of C++.

** tag searches includes auto-included arduino header (based on arduino version)

** srecode/templates/arduino-pde.srt - templates for arduino-mode.

** ede/templates/make.srt - support the Arduino makefile template


* Support for Java Development

** common/cedet-java.el - New support for java utility function
integration, including calling java, jar, and javap

** semantic/semanticdb-javap.el - New semantic database back-end that reads
symbols from jar files.

** EDE projects can now provide a java classpath.

** Parsing support for javap output.

** semantic-decorate-includes
*** support for includes that have a tag table, but no associated file.
This can happen for tags created with semanticdb-javap.

** Smart Completion support for Java:
*** Support 'this' in tag lookups.
*** symbol splitting (on .) for fully qualified names.
*** remove recursive searches through imported symbols.

** SRecode support for more package name differentiation


* Universal context menu

** common/cedet-m3.el - New (mouse 3 universal context menu support).
To enable, use `cedet-m3-minor-mode'.

** ede/ede-m3.el - New m3 support for projects (compile) 
** semantic/semantic-m3.el - New m3 support for Semantic
(smart completion, tag info, etc)
** srecode/srecode-m3.el - New m3 support for SRecode
(inserting templates)


* EDE Changes

** Security Fixes:
*** ede-project-directories: New variable tracking safe projects.
*** Avoid loading projects unless they are "safe".
*** Some project types are automatically 'safe' if they do not load code from disk.

** Menu support for the Configuration feature.  Allows users to choose the
active configuration (such as debug or install) from a menu.

** ede-set : new command to interactively set project-local variables.

** Generic projects
*** Support for compile, debug, and running.

** Disable local variable reading if EDE needs to pull an Emacs Lisp file
into a buffer temporarilly.

** Fixed vc-dir support

** Autoconf editing support for M4 macros with complex arguments.

** EDE developers can now flush the directory hash, forcing EDE to re-check
a directory for the project it belongs to.

** Linux project type - support compilation

** EDE autoload structures no longer load the ede project Emacs Lisp code
unless a project of that type exists.

** When building a project keymap, combine target and project keybindings
together.

** Fix bug allowing new targets to be created in dired-mode

** Deprecated: ede-simple.el


* Semantic Changes

** C/C++
*** Parsing includes inside a namespace.
*** Use c-scan-conditionals when available during lexical analysis
*** Improved extern "C" support
*** Support to ignore more common special preprocessor symbols, such as
__nonnull, and __asm.
*** Add __cplusplus macro when parsing C++.
*** Use cdefs.h as a source of preprocessor symbols.
*** Improved function pointer parsing.

** clang
*** New support for clang for smart completion.

** Javascript
*** Support for js-mode and js2-mode

** Fortran - New parser support
*** semantic/bovine/f90.by, semantic/bovine/semantic-f90.el - New parser
support for Fortran

** Python
*** Support to convert imports to include files names.
*** Ability to dynamically determine the python load path.
*** Support for WITH & AT keywords
*** Python3k support

** Exuberent CTags
*** Support for Debian installs of ctags

** Replace semantic-analyze-tag-prototype-p with semantic-tag-prototype-p.

** semantic-create-tag-proxy, semantic-tag-set-proxy, semantic-tag-resolve-proxy
new utilities to enable the creation of tags that represent things that
does not resolve to code in a buffer.  eg - directory package names in java.

** semantic-complete - improve tooltip completion list display.


* SRecode Changes

** Tag generation supports constructor/destructor settings

** Tag generation supports system include differentiation

** Added 'Framework' support.  Frameworks are specified when a particular
kind of library (such as Android) is needed in a common language mode (like
Java).

** Support nested templates and have variables override based on priority.

** Support merging tables from multiple related modes, such as the stack of
modes: default -> c++ -> arduino


* COGRE Changes


* EIEIO

** Security Fixes: eieio-persistent-read now takes an extra argument
specifying the class being loaded.
*** Any other class is never read in.
*** New specialized reader for pulling in classes, and erroring without
evaluation suspicious code.
*** All slots that contain objects must have a :type.  Slots with lists of
objects must use a new type predicate for a list of an object type.

** classes produce a new predicates that returns t on an input that is a
list of that object type.

** Added filename support to generated symbols to support find-function and
similar utilities.


* General changes

** Continued support for Emacs 22, Emacs 23

** Support for Emacs 24 and lexbind compatibility.

** Improved error messages if CEDET is installed incorrectly.

** Update cscope support for version 15.7

** Support for SXEmacs
*** Version number checking in SXEmacs
*** SXEmacs source code support in EDE
*** Bug fixes


** Many Updated test suites.

** Many bug fixes
