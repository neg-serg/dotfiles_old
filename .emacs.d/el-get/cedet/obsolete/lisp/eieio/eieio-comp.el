;; Byte compiler functions for defmethod.  This will affect the new GNU
;; byte compiler for Emacs 19 and better.  This function will be called by
;; the byte compiler whenever a `defmethod' is encountered in a file.
;; It will output a function call to `eieio-defmethod' with the byte
;; compiled function as a parameter.

;;; Code:

(declare-function eieio-defgeneric-form "eieio" (method doc-string))
