This attempts to demonstrate on a small scale the problem described at:
  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=515650CE.3030908%40siege-engine.com&forum_name=cedet-semantic

Problem:
    * When using GNU Global backend with semantic-symref, more files
      are loaded than should be needed to find the prototypes.
    * The reason is that the symbol is in a namespace, and that
      namespace is looked up to make sure the hits are in the correct
      namespaces.

The Instructions:
    * Run the cit-globalref test.  This will:
      ** Copy these files into /tmp
      ** Run 'global' on the directory to create a database.
      ** Run two tests.

    * One of the tests verifies that the symbol in the namespace only
      loads the files once.  (They used to be loaded multiple times.)
    * A second teste makes sure that only the one file hit is loaded,
      but that has no namespaces involved.

TODO:
    * It should be possible to restrict the namespace loading only to
      those files that have hits.  That is a task for a different day.
