;;; Commentary:
;;
;; EIEIO is a series of Lisp routines which implements a subset of
;; CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System.  In addition, EIEIO also adds
;; a few new features which help it integrate more strongly with the
;; Emacs running environment.
;;
;; See eieio.texi for complete documentation on using this package.
;;
;; Note: the implementation of the c3 algorithm is based on:
;;   Kim Barrett et al.: A Monotonic Superclass Linearization for Dylan
;;   Retrieved from:
;;   http://192.220.96.201/dylan/linearization-oopsla96.html

;; There is funny stuff going on with typep and deftype.  This
;; is the only way I seem to be able to make this stuff load properly.

;; @TODO - fix :initform to be a form, not a quoted value
;; @TODO - Prefix non-clos functions with `eieio-'.

(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))       ;FIXME: Use cl-lib!

;;; Defining a new class
;;
(defmacro defclass (name superclass slots &rest options-and-doc)
  "Define NAME as a new class derived from SUPERCLASS with SLOTS.
OPTIONS-AND-DOC is used as the class' options and base documentation.
SUPERCLASS is a list of superclasses to inherit from, with SLOTS
being the slots residing in that class definition.  NOTE: Currently
only one slot may exist in SUPERCLASS as multiple inheritance is not
yet supported.  Supported tags are:

  :initform   - Initializing form.
  :initarg    - Tag used during initialization.
  :accessor   - Tag used to create a function to access this slot.
  :allocation - Specify where the value is stored.
                Defaults to `:instance', but could also be `:class'.
  :writer     - A function symbol which will `write' an object's slot.
  :reader     - A function symbol which will `read' an object.
  :type       - The type of data allowed in this slot (see `typep').
  :documentation
              - A string documenting use of this slot.

The following are extensions on CLOS:
  :protection - Specify protection for this slot.
                Defaults to `:public'.  Also use `:protected', or `:private'.
  :custom     - When customizing an object, the custom :type.  Public only.
  :label      - A text string label used for a slot when customizing.
  :group      - Name of a customization group this slot belongs in.
  :printer    - A function to call to print the value of a slot.
                See `eieio-override-prin1' as an example.

A class can also have optional options.  These options happen in place
of documentation (including a :documentation tag), in addition to
documentation, or not at all.  Supported options are:

  :documentation - The doc-string used for this class.

Options added to EIEIO:

  :allow-nil-initform - Non-nil to skip typechecking of null initforms.
  :custom-groups      - List of custom group names.  Organizes slots into
                        reasonable groups for customizations.
  :abstract           - Non-nil to prevent instances of this class.
                        If a string, use as an error string if someone does
                        try to make an instance.
  :method-invocation-order
                      - Control the method invocation order if there is
                        multiple inheritance.  Valid values are:
                         :breadth-first - The default.
                         :depth-first

Options in CLOS not supported in EIEIO:

  :metaclass - Class to use in place of `standard-class'
  :default-initargs - Initargs to use when initializing new objects of
                      this class.

Due to the way class options are set up, you can add any tags you wish,
and reference them using the function `class-option'."
  ;; This is eval-and-compile only to silence spurious compiler warnings
  ;; about functions and variables not known to be defined.
  ;; When eieio-defclass code is merged here and this becomes
  ;; transparent to the compiler, the eval-and-compile can be removed.

  INITARGS is a property list with keywords based on the :initarg
for each slot.  For example:

  (make-instance 'foo :slot1 value1 :slotN valueN)

Compatibility note:

If the first element of INITARGS is a string, it is used as the
name of the class.

In EIEIO, the class' constructor requires a name for use when printing.
`make-instance' in CLOS doesn't use names the way Emacs does, so the
class is used as the name slot instead when INITARGS doesn't start with
a string."

function has no body, as its purpose is to decide which method body

currently ignored.  You can use `defgeneric' to apply specialized
top level documentation to a method."

modifies how the method is called, including:
   :before  - Method will be called before the :primary
   :primary - The default if not specified
   :after   - Method will be called after the :primary
   :static  - First arg could be an object or class
The next argument is the ARGLIST.  The ARGLIST specifies the arguments
to the method as with `defun'.  The first argument can have a type
specifier, such as:
  ((VARNAME CLASS) ARG2 ...)
where VARNAME is the name of the local variable for the method being
created.  The CLASS is a class symbol for a class made with `defclass'.
A DOCSTRING comes after the ARGLIST, and is optional.
All the rest of the args are the BODY of the method.  A method will
return the value of the last form in the BODY.
