This directory contains library files needed for older Emacs version
to work with current CEDET:

* autoload.el: This is autoload.el taken from Emacs 23.2, needed for
  Emacs 23.1 to generate proper autoloads for CEDET.

* dominate.el: This has Emacs 24.3's version of
  `locate-dominating-file' that accepts a function in the NAME
  parameter, as needed by EDE.
