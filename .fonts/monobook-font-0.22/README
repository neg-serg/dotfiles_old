I. Building
  a) tar xjvf monobook-font-<version>.tar.bz2
  b) cd monobook-font-<version>
  c) make
     Make will generate pcf.gz, psf.gz and raw (for bsd) fonts. PCF fonts generated
     with ISO10646-1 encoding, PSF and RAW - with KOI8-R. If you need other, just
     comment appropriate line in Makefile and uncomment another one. You also can
     run "make pcf", "make psf" or "make raw" to build only what you want.

II. Installing
  1. X Window System
    a) Make sure you are root.
    b) Go to the X fonts directory (/usr/share/fonts or /usr/share/X11/fonts or
       something else, depending on your OS) and create new subdirectory, for example
       cd /usr/share/fonts
       mkdir monobook
    c) Copy all files from monobook-font-<version>/pcf to created directory. Then cd
       to this directory and run mkfontdir.
    d) Add line to the "Files" section of your xorg.conf. For example:
       Section "Files"
          <some other staff>
          FontPath	"/usr/share/fonts/monobook/"
          <some other staff>
       EndSection
    e) Restart X.
  2. Linux console
    a) Copy all files from monobook-font-<version>/psf to /usr/share/consolefonts.
    b) See your distribution's documentation if you want to know how to load this
       font at boot.
  3. *BSD console
    a) I don't use BSD.
    b) If you are, you know better where to put fonts and how to load them.
